REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev/File Photo The draft law would, if adopted, mean the Russian central bank no longer has to publish a list of banks dealing with the arms industry, which included eight lenders as of Oct. 1.
Russia’s government and the president would be able to include any banks they wanted to in such deals and would no longer publish the criteria for their involvement.
Under current regulations only state-controlled or central bank-controlled lenders with capital of not less then 100 billion rubles ($1.7 billion) may get such contracts.
Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting on Tuesday to discuss building up the country’s military.
The U.S. State Department last month named 39 Russian defense and intelligence-related entities following the signing in August of a new sanctions law by President Donald Trump to punish Moscow after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded it meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, allegations the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.
The U.S. law calls on the president to impose sanctions on anyone he identifies as having engaged “in a significant transaction with a person that is part of, or operates for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors” of the Russian government..
The action does not itself impose new sanctions, and determinations will be made on a case by case basis, State Department officials said in October.
Banks on the list include state-controlled majors Sberbank, VTB and Russian Agriculture Bank, along with private-owned Rossiya and Gazprombank, in which gas producer Gazprom holds a stake.
Sberbank has proposed establishing a special bank to finance Russia’s military industry as a means of side-stepping the sanctions, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.
Sberbank declined to comment.

The order, proposed in May, would roll back the Barack Obama administration's classification of internet service providers as ""common carriers"" under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. As common carriers, internet providers are required to act as neutral gateways to the internet. In other words, companies like Comcast are not allowed to speed up or slow down content passing through their networks. If the order passes, ISPs will be reclassified as ""information service"" providers, as they were between February 1996 and February 2015. For almost twenty years, the Internet thrived under the light-touch regulatory approach established by President Clinton and a Republican Congress. This bipartisan framework led the private sector to invest $1.5 trillion building communications networks throughout the United States. And it gave us an Internet economy that became the envy of the world. Apple and dozens of other large technology companies urged the FCC to reconsider its proposal. The FCC also received a record-breaking 22 million comments from the public during a feedback period that ended in August. Those against the order believe that the FCC rolling back the internet's classification as a public utility will hurt net neutrality, as it could eventually divide internet users into so-called ""fast lanes"" and ""slow lanes."" In a letter submitted to the FCC in August, Apple warned that paid fast lanes could result in an ""internet with distorted competition."" Broadband providers should not create paid fast lanes on the internet. Lifting the current ban on paid prioritization arrangements could allow broadband providers to favor the transmission of one provider's content or services (or the broadband providerâs own online content or services) over other online content, fundamentally altering the internet as we know it todayâto the detriment of consumers, competition, and innovation. Pai, who was designated as FCC chairman by Donald Trump, insists the Obama-era internet regulations are a ""mistake."" Under the new rules, he said the FCC will ""stop micromanaging the internet"" to foster innovation. Today, I have shared with my colleagues a draft order that would abandon this failed approach and return to the longstanding consensus that served consumers well for decades. Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet. Instead, the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that's best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate. Despite the significant backlash from tech companies and the public, it is widely expected that the FCC will vote in favor of the order next month.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has made immigration enforcement a core part of his pitch in his run for governor, is criticizing his ally Donald Trump, charging that White House failed a “big test” on immigration by moving too slowly to end special deportation protections for nearly 60,000 Haitians. 
Kobach, who writes for Breitbart News, told the hard-right outlet that a decision to give Haitian nationals 18 months to remain in the United States despite terminating their protected status, known as Temporary Protected Status, undermined the Trump administration’s immigration principles. 
“[Extension of TPS for Haitians] sends a bad signal that the Trump administration may not really be as interested in enforcing the law as first thought,” Kobach said. “I think its really important now that White House reassure the country that they will … not follow executive amnesties.” 
Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Elaine Duke announced Monday that the administration was revoking TPS for tens of thousands of Haitians, most of whom live in Miami. But DHS also said it was providing the Haitians 18 months to make arrangements to return to their homeland. Never miss a local story.

A Trump administration official said it also provides time for Congress to seek another legal avenue for Haitians nationals to remain. 
“Only Congress can take action to reform the TPS program or address the concerns voiced by many that these individuals should have a future in the United States,” a senior administration official said. 
The United States granted TPS to Haitian nationals living in the United States after a 2000 earthquake that left more than 300,000 dead, 1.5 million homeless and an equal number injured. While the country continues to suffer from extreme poverty, the administration said that conditions for which TPS was granted have largely been resolved. 
Proponents of TPS for people from Central America and Haiti argue that ending the designation for those countries is counterproductive and could also spur more illegal immigration. 
“I travelled to #Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 and after hurricane Matthew in 2016. So I can personally attest that #Haiti is not prepared to take back nearly 60,000 #TPS recipients under these difficult and harsh conditions,” Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fl., wrote in a tweet Monday night. 
Kobach was an early supporter of Trump’s candidacy and advised him on immigration policy throughout the campaign. He was named vice chair of a presidential commission tasked with researching voter fraud in May, and the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., is joining Kobach at a fundraiser in Overland Park next week, the Kansas City Star reported . 
Still, this is not the first time that Kobach has criticized the adminstration’s handling of TPS. Earlier this month, Kobach charged that the TPS protections are being abused. 
“It is an absurd abuse of the law to continue extending the Honduran illegal aliens’ stay in the United States when an entire generation of Hondurans has been born since the hurricane,” Kobach wrote in a Breitbart column .","{'uuid': 'c986bc4e3a8e12c97ca2869102ac055da323be53', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_M9wMZ9HRX0qXneuaquPf6We9HvsRdLQ2bzp0NcKjEiHR6UooZsbWoC4FFPdVsWxFX51RfWOt0f5qyuLkqmhFn', 'site_full': 'www.fresnobee.com', 'site': 'fresnobee.com', 'site_section': 'http://www.fresnobee.com/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=19311519&getXmlFeed=true', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'Breaking News, Sports, Weather & More | FresnoBee.com &', 'title': 'Kobach: Trump failed ‘big test’ on immigration with Haiti', 'title_full': 'Kobach: Trump failed ‘big test’ on immigration with Haiti', 'published': '2017-11-21T19:19:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'http://pics.mcclatchyinteractive.com/news/politics-government/vrmryw/picture185814123/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/kobach', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 51243, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",Kobach: Trump failed ‘big test’ on immigration with Haiti,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_M9wMZ9HRX0qXneuaquPf6We9HvsRdLQ2bzp0NcKjEiHR6UooZsbWoC4FFPdVsWxFX51RfWOt0f5qyuLkqmhFn,c986bc4e3a8e12c97ca2869102ac055da323be53

Posted: By Julia Carpenter 
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It's been called the Weinstein effect. 
Following the bombshell investigations into Harvey Weinstein's conduct, more people began to speak out about sexual harassment, leading to a string of allegations against other prominent men like Charlie Rose, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Jeffrey Tambor, Al Franken and others. Many of the accused have paid a steep price for their behavior. 
But why now? 
America has had its share of news-making scandals before. Anita Hill testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991, and Thomas still sits on the Supreme Court today. 
Decades of assault accusations followed former television star Bill Cosby even as his star was rising. And in 2016, the ""Access Hollywood"" tape depicting then-candidate Donald Trump boasting of sexual assault did not stop his ultimate presidential victory. 
So what's different in the moment we're experiencing now? 
We know their names 
Many of the women who spoke out against Weinstein -- Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan -- are famous names. In previous high-profile sexual harassment cases, it's usually the men who are more well-known (see: Bill O'Reilly, Clarence Thomas). Experts say that the previous power dynamic -- the famous man accused by the less-famous woman -- only bolstered a false narrative, one that discredited women's stories. 
In Weinstein's case, however, as more women added their own allegations to a growing list, people paid attention. 
""What do we focus on in our society? Movies and social media and People magazine,"" says Tracy Thomas, law professor at the University of Akron. ""So those are the voices that finally ... make a difference."" 
And to people watching around the world, the women's fame cemented the credibility of their stories. 
""Class and race and stature play into whether someone is believed,"" says Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center. ""The nature of who is telling the story mattered here."" 
Other women are sharing their stories 
Since Hill testified in 1991, the way in which people show support for survivors has changed, says Renee Knake, professor at the University of Houston Law Center. 
Case in point: the words we use. 
""When Anita testified, women supported her, but they said, 'I believe Anita,'"" Knake says. ""And the reason why they believed her is because it was happening to them, but no one wanted to face what she endured. Now, women are saying, 'Me, too,' which is more tangible and more concrete."" 
The advent of social media, and the way women now turn to it to share their own stories, on their own terms, has created ""a critical mass"" of testimonials, Knake says. 
""Suddenly, when you have more people speaking, that always creates a tipping point,"" Thomas says. It's harder for critics to say, ""'They can't all be overly sensitive. They can't all be lying,'"" she added. 
And more importantly, these testimonials made an issue that was otherwise removed from many lives into something personal. 
And when it's personal, Thomas says, you're encouraged to share your story, too -- whether on Facebook, with your friends or in an HR office making a formal complaint. 
""It definitely helps having a few women speak out in a public way, because it opens it up to everyone else,"" says Heni Kovács, who experienced workplace harassment in 2016 and reported it to her boss. 
She says she still felt hesitant about telling friends or her past coworkers, even months after leaving the job. But now, in the midst of this #metoo moment, she says she's encouraged by other women sharing stories. She feels like she can finally be open about her past experience. 
""Everyone feels like the times are calling for it. You know it's not an isolated incident."" 
Men are paying attention 
Thomas says the recent outpouring of support for harassment survivors has also engaged a critical population: men. 
At previous sexual harassment flashpoints throughout American history, men were listening, but they weren't engaged. 
But in the last month, the #metoo campaign and barrage of accusations has made the issue personal for millions of women -- and men -- as they shared their own harassment stories or realized this issue had touched every woman they knew. 
Thomas points to the important role men have played in previous women's rights milestones. Just a century ago, in the fight for suffrage, women relied on male supporters to add their voices to the conversation. In harnessing such widespread support and demonstrating in numbers before the White House, advocates won women the right to vote in 1920. 
""Just like any movement when we're talking about women, bringing men into that dialogue is so critical and must really be taken seriously,"" Thomas says.

It will launch in late February and will air Sundays at 10 p.m. By Hadas Gold 
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin is getting his own weekly program on Fox News, he told CNN in an interview Tuesday morning shortly before the network announced the news. 
The show, which Levin said will be called ""Life, Liberty & Levin,"" will launch in late February and will air Sundays at 10 p.m. 
""I was approached and it was very enticing,"" Levin told CNN. ""The format will be long-form interview, where we discuss philosophy, history, economics and the constitution as they relate to current events and the state of the nation."" 
Levin said the program would feature guests who are ""not necessarily prominent people but people who are consequential in various fields."" 
Conservative news heavyweight Matt Drudge first broke the news of Levin's show on Twitter Tuesday morning. Drudge previously also broke the news that Laura Ingraham, herself a radio host and longtime Fox News contributor, would get her own show in September. Fox News formally announced Levin's show about within an hour of Drudge's tweet. 
The show will fill a void in Fox News' Sunday primetime line up. The slot Levin is filling had been something of an afterthought for the network, which has been replaying its Sunday morning news show ""Fox News Sunday"" hosted by Chris Wallace at that time. 
Levin, a former official in President Ronald Reagan's Justice Department, will continue to host his long-running daily syndicated radio program ""The Mark Levin Show."" Levin said he will also continue his show ""Levin TV"" on the conservative streaming channel CRTV. Saying both would continue, Levin joked that he ""never sleeps"" and already works seven days a week. 
Levin has also written seven books, most recently ""Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progessivism,"" which was released earlier this year. 
Drudge also reported in his Tuesday tweet that Levin recently met with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the White House. Levin confirmed the meetings, saying he had lunch with Pence and then stopped in to say hello to Trump. 
""I had lunch with the vice president at his request just to say hi, and then I was invited to say hello to the president briefly, which is exactly what I did,"" Levin said. 
In Fox's official announcement of the show, President of Programming Suzanne Scott said, ""Mark's passion for the principles found in the Constitution and success in talk radio has made him a distinct figure in the media landscape. We look forward to adding this spirited program to our weekend lineup."" 
Levin added in a statement, ""I am honored to join FOX News, a network I have enjoyed appearing on as a guest for quite some time. As a proud citizen of the United States, I am delighted to share the significance of American values with such a wide audience and look forward to engaging with important guests about crucial topics.""

New indications that Donald Trump Jr. may soon find his name on Russia investigation Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment docket emerged this week as two previously unrevealed Russian contacts with Donald Trump’s son came to light, raising new questions about the younger Trump’s possible involvement in a wide-ranging collusion scheme between Russia and the Trump campaign to rig the 2016 presidential election. 
Trump Jr. became a central figure in the Russia collusion investigation in July go this year, when media reports revealed that on June 9, 2016, he held a meeting in New York’s Trump Tower with eight allegedly Kremlin-connected Russians who had promised to give him derogatory information about the elder Trump’s Democratic election opponent, Hillary Clinton. 
Trump Jr. was told that the meeting was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” That message was conveyed by Rob Goldstone, a music manager who represented aspiring Russian pop singer, Emin Agalarov, the son of the Russian oligarch real estate developer, Aras Agalarov, and an executive in his father’s business. Aras Agalarov is also a close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin and a business partner of the Trumps. 
But on Monday, a report by The Daily Beast online magazine revealed that one of Trump Jr.’s contacts at that Trump Tower meeting, accused money launderer Irakly “Ike” Kaveladze, had advance knowledge that the Russian government possessed “dirt” on Clinton; knowledge he obtained from one of Emin Agalraov’s high school friends.

Emin Agalarov was reportedly the instigator of the Trump Tower meeting between the Russians and Trump Jr.; a meeting also attended by the elder Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-Campaign Manager Paul Manafort. Kaveladze, who had worked for the Agalarovs’company , Crocus Group, was invited to attend the meeting and flew from Los Angeles to New York City to be there, though he was told only that the meeting would be a discussion of “Magnitsky Act” sanctions against Russia. 
But a few days before the meeting he was told that the Clinton “dirt” would also be discussed. The person who told him was another Crocus employee, Roman Beniaminov; a high school friend of Emin Agalarov when the pair attended school in Tenafly, New Jersey, according to the Daily Beast report, which also reported that Beniaminov was acting as at least a part-time manager for Emin Agalarov’s singing career. 
Emin Agalarov posted a photo of the pair from their high school years on his Facebook page. 
While Mueller will likely want to know more about how the group of Russians, all of whom appeared to know in advance about “dirt” on Clinton, came into Trump Jr.’s orbit, the Special Counsel now appears certain also to inquire about Trump Jr.’s meeting with Alexander Torshin, a top executive at Russia’s state-run central bank, and who has been suspected by police in Europe of being the “godfather” of a major Russian organized crime syndicate. 
Torshin, a staunch Putin supporter, attempted to set up a “backdoor” meeting between Trump and Putin last year during the presidential campaign, but was rejected by Kushner; reportedly when Torshin’s alleged criminal connections became evident. 
But despite the rebuff from Kushner, Torshin was able to meet with Trump Jr. in May of 2016 at a National Rifle Association event. According to a CBS News report , a source said that Trump Jr. and Torshin spoke for “two or three minutes” focusing on their mutual interest in firearms. The presidential campaign was not discussed in the meeting, according to the CBS News report. 
Torshin operates a Russian pro-gun organization known as “The Right to Bear Arms,” which advocates “Christianity and gun rights,” and he has been called “the conservatives’ favorite Russian.” Mueller will likely show an interest in any role Torshin may have played in what Goldstone called “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

Source: Tweet 
The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission has unveiled plans to repeal a landmark 2015 order that barred internet service providers from blocking or slowing down consumer access to web content. 
On Tuesday FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a December 14 meeting on rescinding the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities. 
With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a ""power grab"" by Obama. 
""The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and pre-emptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,"" Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised ""heavy-handed"" regulation of the internet. 
The net neutrality rules, aimed at giving consumers equal access to web content, also forbade broadband providers from charging consumers more for certain content, a practice called ""paid prioritisation"". 
Pai said state and local governments ""need to be preempted"" from imposing their own net neutrality rules because broadband internet service is ""inherently an interstate service"". 
The FCC's planned action represents a victory for internet service providers including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, which had urged the FCC to revoke the rules. The companies have said that repealing the could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing.

By MATTHEW PENNINGTONAssociated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration readied new sanctions Tuesday on North Korea, a day after declaring it a state sponsor of terrorism in a move to put additional pressure on Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
North Korea has joined Iran, Sudan and Syria on America's terror blacklist, a largely symbolic step as the administration already has the authority to impose virtually any sanctions it wants on Kim Jong Un's government over its nuclear weapons development. 
As part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign, President Donald Trump said the Treasury Department would impose more sanctions on North Korea and ""related persons"" starting Tuesday, without hinting who or what would be targeted. The move is part of rolling effort to deprive Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs and leave it internationally isolated. 
""It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it's finished over a two-week period,"" Trump said. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday the pressure campaign was starting to bite in Pyongyang, which is already facing unprecedented U.N.-mandated sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Tillerson said anecdotal evidence and intelligence suggests the North is now suffering fuel shortages, with queues at gas stations, and its revenues are down. 
The United States has been applying sanctions of its own as well. 
In Tokyo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the move, telling reporters Japan supports the step as a way to increase pressure on North Korea. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang expressed concern. 
Lu said Tuesday that the situation is ""highly sensitive"" and that it would be ""helpful to bring all parties back to the negotiation table instead of doing the opposite."" 
Da Zhigang, a North Korea expert at the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said the move ""will arouse diplomatic reactions and hatred toward the U.S. from North Korea"" and could even prompt the North to resume missile tests. 
An editorial Tuesday in North Korea's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called Trump a ""heinous criminal"" who had insulted the dignity of the country's supreme leadership and its socialist system during his recent visit to South Korea. The editorial, carried by the state-run news agency, threatened ""merciless punishment."" It did not mention the terror designation. 
In September, Trump opened the way for the U.S. to punish foreign companies dealing with North Korea. He issued an executive order expanding the Treasury Department's ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with the North, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system. 
Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow on Northeast Asia at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Treasury could be preparing more designations against North Korean entities related to the terrorism listing, or possibly Chinese or other companies violating the September order. 
A potential target would be Chinese banks that serve as North Korea's conduit to the international system. Such a move would irk Beijing, whose help Trump is counting on to put an economic squeeze on Pyongyang. China recently sent its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years to discuss the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula. 
Tillerson urged China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's external trade, to take unilateral steps to cut fuel supplies to its wayward neighbor. China, which is calling for dialogue to ease the nuclear tensions, is reluctant to exert economic pressure that could destabilize the North. 
Tillerson acknowledged a two-month pause in the North's rapid tempo of nuclear and missile tests and said there was still hope for diplomacy. With tougher sanctions in the offing, he warned Kim, ""This is only going to get worse until you're ready to come and talk."" 
The terror designation, however, is likely to exacerbate sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim. North Korea shows no interest in talks aimed at getting it to give up its nukes. 
North Korea has been on and off the terror list over the years. It was designated for two decades because of its involvement in international terror attacks in the 1980s, then taken off in 2008 to smooth the way for nuclear talks that soon failed.

The White House said President Donald Trump talked with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, a day after the Russian leader held discussions with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad about a political resolution to end nearly seven years of fighting in Syria. Trump and Putin spoke informally several times last week when they both were attending a Southeast Asia summit in Vietnam. Among other issues, they discussed principles for the future of war-wracked Syria, where about 400,000 people have been killed and millions of refugees have been forced to flee their homes because of the fighting. The Kremlin said Tuesday it called Assad to the Black Sea resort of Sochi for talks with Putin about Russia's peace proposals for Syria, ahead of Putin's summit Wednesday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) embraces Syrian President Bashar Assad in the Bocharov Ruchei residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia, Nov. 20, 2017. 
Russia has bolstered Assad's rule with airstrikes since late 2015 against groups trying to overthrow his regime, with Iranian fighters also supporting Damascus, and Turkey backing the Syrian opposition. His power ensured, Asssad said he expressed his gratitude to Putin ""for all of the efforts that Russia made to save our country."" Putin, according to the Kremlin, told Assad Russia's ""military operation is coming to an end. Thanks to the Russian army, Syria has been saved as a state. Much has been done to stabilize the situation in Syria."" He praised Assad, predicting terrorism would suffer an ""inevitable"" defeat in Syria. The Kremlin quoted Assad as saying, ""It is in our interest to advance the political process. ... We don't want to look back. And we are ready for dialogue with all those who want to come up with a political settlement."" U.N.-led peace talks about Syria are scheduled for November 28 in Geneva.

World manufacturing activity expanded to a 78-month high of 53.5 in October, with faster rates recorded in new orders, exports, employment and input prices.
Additional trends and indicators support my bullishness. Worldwide business optimism, as recorded by October’s IHS Markit Global Business Outlook survey, climbed to its highest level in three years, with profits growth and hiring plans continuing to hit multiyear highs. Optimism among U.S. firms was at its highest since 2014, with sentiment above the global average for the second straight survey period.
Small business owners’ optimism remained at historically high levels in October, according to the latest survey conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). Its Small Business Optimism Index came in at 103.8, up slightly from September and extending the trend we’ve seen since the November 2016 election.
As I told CNBC Asia anchor Bernie Lo, U.S., Europe and China’s economies are strong, which is igniting the rest of the world. The eurozone purchasing manager’s index (PMI), in particular—rising to 58.5 in October, an 80-month high—is very constructive for world economic growth in the next six months.

Fewest Number of Countries in Recession Speaking on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” recently, Deutsche Bank chief international economist Torsten Slok made the case that global economic health “has never been more robust,” citing the fact that the number of countries in recession has dropped to its lowest level in decades. 
“We have never seen a smaller number of countries in recession as we do at the moment,” Slok said. “And if you look ahead to the next few years… we are going to see that fall even lower.”
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) backs up this claim in its quarterly economic outlook. According to the Paris-based group, synchronized global growth is finally within sight, with no major economy in contraction mode for the first time since 2008. World GDP is expected to advance 3.5 percent in 2017—its best year since 2011—and 3.7 percent in 2018.
Taken together, this should help boost exports and global trade even further as more countries have the capital and demand to make purchases on the world market.
Exposure to Foreign Markets Boosted Companies’ Bottom Line Bolstered by a weaker U.S. dollar, exports by American firms hit a three-year high in August, the Commerce Department reported this month. Exports rose to nearly $200 billion, the highest level since December 2014.
As further proof that the global economy is humming along, S&P 500 Index companies with greater exposure to foreign markets, especially Europe, saw higher revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter than those companies whose business is more focused domestically.
According to FacSet data, revenue grew 10 percent year-over-year for firms that generated 50 percent or more of their sales outside the U.S., compared to only 4.2 percent for firms whose sales were conducted mostly within the U.S. The difference was even greater for earnings growth—13.4 percent for S&P 500 companies with strong foreign exposure, 2.3 percent for companies with less exposure.
We saw similarly impressive results with Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) companies. According to FactSet’s November 17 Earnings Insight: 
Overall, 11 of the 30 companies in the DJIA provided revenue growth numbers for Europe for the third quarter. Of these 11 companies, nine reported year-over-year growth in revenues. This number was the highest number of Dow 30 companies… to report revenue growth in Europe on a quarter basis since Q2 2014. Of these nine companies, five reported double-digit revenue growth in Europe for the third quarter.
FactSet adds that Nike reported its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in European markets, Apple its fifth straight quarter.
95 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings for the third quarter, and of those, nearly three quarters have logged earnings per share (""EPS"") that are above the five-year average.
The U.S. isn’t the only economy that’s had a standout quarter. According to Thomson Reuters data, 65 percent of companies in the MSCI Europe Index have beaten third-quarter expectations, with overall year-over-year earnings growth standing at nearly 10 percent.
Enthusiasm Over Corporate Tax Cuts Drive Stock Prices Higher As you’re likely aware, it’s been one year since the U.S. election, and since then the market has surged more than 21 percent on improved global growth, higher corporate earnings and hopes that President Trump’s pro-growth agenda of tax reform and deregulation will improve business conditions in the U.S. In the past 12 months, there have been nearly three times as many weeks posting market gains above 1 percent than those with losses below negative 1 percent. This makes it one of the most profitable markets to have invested in for many years.
So where does the Trump rally rank? Looking at the 12 months following every November presidential election since 1950, LPL Research found that the bull run we’ve seen under Trump ranks fifth place, following Presidents Bush Sr. in 1988; Obama in 2012; Kennedy in 1960 and, in first place, Clinton in 1996, with gains climbing to nearly 32 percent.

Before year’s end, we could see prices appreciate even more as investors act on enthusiasm over tax reform. The House approved $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that, if signed into law, would slash corporate taxes down from 35 percent to a much more competitive 20 percent. The bill is now in the Senate’s court where hopefully it doesn’t suffer the same fate as the failed Obamacare repeal-and-replace efforts. Goldman Sachs analysts place the chances of tax reform being completed by early 2018 at 80 percent—encouraging for sure, but there are some tough challenges ahead. A handful of Republican Senators, including Jeff Flake ( AZ ) and Ron Johnson (WI), have already said they will not vote for the Senate bill as it’s currently written.
Despite the bill’s uncertain future, markets responded very favorably to the House news. The S&P 500 Index closed up 0.82 percent on Thursday, its best one-day move since June, with gains led by retailers such as Foot Locker, Ross Stores and Gap.
I’ll have more to add on consumer spending forecasts for the upcoming holiday shopping season soon. This Black Friday is expected to be the largest-ever for online shopping!
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector. The PMI is based on five major indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries and the employment environment.
The Business Outlook Survey for Global Manufacturing and Services is based on a survey of around 11,000 manufacturers and service providers that are asked to give their thoughts on future business conditions. The reports are produced on a tri-annual basis, with data collected in February, June and October.
The Small Business Optimism Index is compiled from a survey that is conducted each month by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) of its members.
The Standard & Poor's 500, often abbreviated as the S&P 500, or just the S&P, is an American stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ.

By a 3-2 vote, the Nebraska Public Service Commission (PSC) on Monday approved an alternative route through the state for TransCanada’s Keystone XL Pipeline. 
Commissioners approved an order giving TransCanada permission to build the $8 billion Keystone XL Pipeline using the Mainline Alternative Route. This route was one of three proposed routes through Nebraska included in TransCanada’s permit application. 
Russ Girling, TransCanada president and CEO, said the company was evaluating the PSC’s decision on the 830,000-barrel-per-day pipeline that will carry oil sands crude from terminals in Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, where it can then reach refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
""As a result of today's decision, we will conduct a careful review of the Public Service Commission's ruling while assessing how the decision would impact the cost and schedule of the project,"" Girling said. 
Late in 2015, President Barack Obama rejected a permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline after his administration spent seven years reviewing the project. However, within days after being sworn in earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum to restart the application process. In March, TransCanada received a presidential permit from the U.S. Department of State to construct the 36-inch pipeline. Nebraska was the final state to approve the project. 
The American Petroleum Institute (API) applauded the Nebraska PSC’s decision to approve the Keystone XL permit, noting that it will provide increased energy security, create 42,000 construction jobs and generate $55 million in tax revenue during its first year of operation. 
“The Nebraska Public Service Commission set an example for how to carefully evaluate critical energy infrastructure projects, even in the face of strongly held views and opinions,” said Jack Gerard, API president and CEO. “Pipelines such as this enhance our ability to safely deliver North American energy to our world-class refineries, which in turn provide the fuels and products we all rely on every day.” 
This week, TransCanada is also dealing with the cleanup from a 5,000-barrel leak on the Keystone Pipeline discovered last Friday in Marshall County in northeastern South Dakota. The company said it’s keeping shippers and customers up to date on the situation. The pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to Cushing, Oklahoma, and to Wood River and Patoka, Illinois, is expected to remain shut down during incident. The cause of the leak remains under investigation. 
TransCanada specialists from emergency management, engineering, environmental management and safety are being assisted by contractors and nationally recognized experts. TransCanada said it’s providing state and federal regulators—including the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and the National Response Center (NRC)—with information on an ongoing basis. 
Greg Haas, director of integrated energy for Stratas Advisors in Houston, said the oil and gas industry should expect and plan accordingly for continued opposition to pipeline projects from activists, Native America tribes and environmental groups. 
“Proponents of new pipelines have to do their utmost to prevent any perceptions of rapid-fire planning or a bad process for the permitting,” he said. “Any sort of shortcuts will be highlighted and politicized. The companies themselves have to operate with white-glove attention so that these events that seem to occur from time to time cannot be used as ammunition against new pipelines to come.” 
Hass emphasized that pipeline companies should “anticipate vehement opposition” and operate with care, both in day-to-day operations and in development, permitting and right-of-way acquisitions. 
“We’re in a new era for pipeline development,” he said. “I do think that the protests will continue. Concern about the environment is very real and it’s persistent. I don’t see that falling away.” Related Articles","{'uuid': '0c36c793d24ddcb09cbebbcfb85d465d73a25bf0', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJV6M0WTsPKKxDco5Pvg05jWkj1FMKKr5d9AYmPQ9lrARX7puXRDGb9jk321dqI2Qc2fELnhUQypqzA5h029X9NT8p2wOTgZ5x5PqOsBekza_LjcNQuEA2trshdbuP5smNI-', 'site_full': 'northamericanshalemagazine.com', 'site': 'northamericanshalemagazine.com', 'site_section': 'http://thebakken.com/rss.xml', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'North American Shale magazine - News and Information about Bakken Business & Communities', 'title': 'Keystone XL clears final permit hurdle in Nebraska', 'title_full': 'Keystone XL clears final permit hurdle in Nebraska', 'published': '2017-11-21T16:18:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 0, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': '', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': None, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",Keystone XL clears final permit hurdle in Nebraska,http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJV6M0WTsPKKxDco5Pvg05jWkj1FMKKr5d9AYmPQ9lrARX7puXRDGb9jk321dqI2Qc2fELnhUQypqzA5h029X9NT8p2wOTgZ5x5PqOsBekza_LjcNQuEA2trshdbuP5smNI-,0c36c793d24ddcb09cbebbcfb85d465d73a25bf0
14,,2017-11-21T19:54:22.000+02:00,"{'persons': [], 'organizations': [], 'locations': []}",[],,,english,0,2017-11-21T02:43:00.000+02:00,,"Chicago (AFP) - Regulators in the US state of Nebraska on Monday granted a key approval needed for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, the source of a nearly decade-long feud between environmental activists and the energy industry. Officials in Nebraska granted TransCanada the final major permit it needs to begin construction of the 1,180-mile (1,900 kilometer) pipeline, days after a leak in the existing Keystone line spilled around 5,000 barrels of oil in South Dakota.
In a 3-2 vote, the Nebraska Public Service Commission approved the project, but required the pipeline's operator to use an alternative to its original preferred route.
By state law, the regulatory body was not allowed to consider the risk of leaks or the potential environmental impact.
TransCanada said that, once built, the pipeline extension would connect to an existing network and ferry 830,000 barrels of oil per day from landlocked Alberta, Canada to US Gulf Coast refineries.
In a statement, the company's president Russ Girling said it would evaluate how the commission's decision to approve an alternate route through the state ""would impact the cost and schedule of the project.""
Meanwhile, Canadian Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr welcomed the decision, saying the pipeline would ""strengthen the Canadian resource industry as a whole,"" and ""bring significant economic benefits to Canada for years to come.""
He also said increases in Canadian oil shipments through the new conduit to the United States would bolster the two nations' close energy relationship.
The controversial $5.3 billion project was first proposed in 2008. US President Donald Trump reversed his predecessor Barack Obama's decision to block it.
Construction had been held up by environmental groups and Nebraska landowners concerned about negative environmental and economic impacts.
Supporters have argued that the pipeline is a safer alternative to other forms of ground oil transport, and would create jobs and boost America's affordable energy supply.
Commissioner Crystal Rhoades, who voted ""no"", was the only one to make prepared remarks during the short morning meeting.
She expressed skepticism about the pipeline's touted economic gains, along with concerns that some landowners were not properly informed of the alternative route's path through their property.
""(TransCanada) provided insufficient evidence to substantiate any positive economic impact for Nebraska from this project,"" she said.
The approval of an alternative route could give new grounds for opposing landowners to file an appeal within the next 30 days.
A law firm representing landowners hailed the decision to deny TransCanada its preferred Keystone XL route through Nebraska.
""We will carefully evaluate the Order and meet with our clients,"" attorney Dave Domina said in a statement.
Opposition group Bold Nebraska said the alternative route raises concerns over possible environmental contamination of an area of sand dunes and an aquifer, and also provides new grounds to push back against the pipeline's construction.
""This decision today throws the entire project into a huge legal question mark,"" Jane Kleeb of Bold Nebraska told a news conference.
Kleeb said the alternative route was not reviewed by federal authorities and would force TransCanada to seek new approvals.
The approval of an alternative route ""opens up a huge victory for us in order to fight this now on the federal level,"" she said.","{'uuid': '510b9d90b2e9adf899953b90b50ffdfe4e1cc32e', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJNXYm4RqMjJ9A0NyU8UKvoVLS2WbreVJKJEBDmWPRqBsJIEd7QC.yqrQvNBnZILG2X1OT04qWoAE8C5wL5BfZ4Q--', 'site_full': 'www.yahoo.com', 'site': 'yahoo.com', 'site_section': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/science/', 'site_categories': ['search_engine', 'media', 'tech'], 'section_title': 'Science | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines', 'title': 'US state gives key approval for Keystone pipeline', 'title_full': 'US state gives key approval for Keystone pipeline', 'published': '2017-11-21T02:43:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 0, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aoQxAPuwOrZC4NF12u.2og--~B/aD02ODA7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/Part-WAS-Was7462450-1-1-0.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 5, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 11, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 11}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",US state gives key approval for Keystone pipeline,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJNXYm4RqMjJ9A0NyU8UKvoVLS2WbreVJKJEBDmWPRqBsJIEd7QC.yqrQvNBnZILG2X1OT04qWoAE8C5wL5BfZ4Q--,510b9d90b2e9adf899953b90b50ffdfe4e1cc32e

MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) — The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission set out Tuesday to scrap rules around open internet access, a move that would allow giant cable and telecom companies to throttle broadband speeds and favor their own services if they wish.
Ajit Pai followed through on a pledge to try to repeal “net neutrality” regulations enacted under the Obama administration. The current rules treat internet service providers such as Comcast, AT&T and Verizon as if they were utility companies that provide essential services, like electricity. The rules mandate that they give equal access to all online content and apps.
Pai said those rules discourage investments that could provide even better and faster online access. Instead, he said new rules would force ISPs to be transparent about their services and management policies, and then would let the market decide.
“Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,” Pai said in a statement.
Pai distributed his alternative plan to other FCC commissioners Tuesday in preparation for a Dec. 14 vote. Pai promised to release his entire proposal Wednesday. Although the FCC’s two Democrats said they will oppose the proposal, the repeal is likely to prevail as Republicans dominate 3-2. The vote for net neutrality in 2015 was also along party lines, but Democrats dominated then.
Equal treatment for all web traffic has been a fundamental principle of the internet since its creation but companies have increasingly put their thumb on the scales of access. AT&T, for example, doesn’t count use of its streaming service DirecTV Now against wireless data caps, potentially making it seem cheaper to its cellphone customers than rival TV services. Rivals would have to pay AT&T for that privilege.
Regulators, consumer advocates and some tech companies are concerned that repealing net neutrality will give ISPs even more power to block or slow down rival offerings.
A repeal also opens the ability for ISPs to charge a company like Netflix for a faster path to its customers. Allowing this paid-priority market to exist could skew prices and create winners and losers among fledgling companies that require a high-speed connection to end users.
Pai, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, said in an interview on Fox News Radio that Trump did not have any input on his proposal. Asked whether deregulation would result in higher prices and put speedy internet access out of the reach of blue-collar Americans, Pai said “it’s going to mean exactly the opposite.”
“These heavy-handed regulations have made it harder for the private sector to build out the networks especially in rural America,” Pai said.
In a Wall Street Journal editorial published Tuesday, Pai cited a report by a nonprofit think tank, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, that said investment by the dozen largest ISPs fell about 2 percent from 2015 to 2016, to $61 billion. The group didn’t link the drop solely to the stiffer rules introduced in 2015.
The attempt to repeal net neutrality has triggered protests from consumer groups and internet companies. A data firm called Emprata that was backed by a telecom industry group found in August that after filtering out form letters, the overwhelming majority of comments to the FCC — about 1.8 million — favored net neutrality, compared with just 24,000 who supported its repeal.
Carmen Scurato, director of policy and legal affairs for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said ISPs’ ability to impose monthly caps on data use already act to raise prices and limit access. Repealing net neutrality, she said, “is just erecting more barriers.”
Among those that will be hit hardest are startups that depend on high-speed internet connections for growth, said Colin Angle, co-founder and CEO of iRobot, maker of the Roomba robot vacuum cleaners. He said his own company wouldn’t be dramatically affected in the near term, but the nascent robotics industry overall might.
“The need for these robots to consume bandwidth is certainly on the rise,” Angle said.
Google said in a statement that net neutrality rules “are working well for consumers and we’re disappointed in the proposal announced today.”
Other tech companies were more muted, with some referring instead to their trade group, the Internet Association. Netflix, which had been vocal in support of the rules in 2015, tweeted that it “supports strong #NetNeutrality” and opposes the rules rollback.
But the streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn’t hurt it because it’s now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere.
AT&T executive vice president Joan Marsh said new rules requiring ISPs to disclose their management practices will keep them honest. “Any ISP that is so foolish as to seek to engage in gatekeeping will be quickly and decisively called out,” she said in a statement.
Comcast said its commitment to consumers will remain the same. “We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content,” Comcast’s senior executive vice president David Cohen said.
Pai’s plan also restores the Federal Trade Commission as the main watchdog to protect consumers and promote competition.
But Democratic Commissioner Mignon L. Clyburn said the proposal was “a giveaway to the nation’s largest communications companies.”
Pai’s proposal on net neutrality comes after the Republican-dominated commission voted 3-2 last week to weaken rules meant to support independent local media, undoing a ban on companies owning newspapers and broadcast stations in a single market.

Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has been caught badmouthing Donald Trump and Roy Moore to a Republican mayor who responded by calling the president an ‘idiot’. 
At a tax reform event in Arizona on Friday, Flake appeared to forget that he was still wearing his mic when he told Mesa mayor John Giles: ‘If we become the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast.’ 
Giles replied by urging him to run for president himself, saying: ‘I’m not throwing smoke at you but you’re the guy that could… just for fun. 
‘Think how much fun it would be just to be the foil and point out what an idiot this guy is.’ 
The pair had just finished answering questions on the subject and had not yet taken off their microphones.

18,admin,2017-11-21T19:54:51.000+02:00,"{'persons': [], 'organizations': [], 'locations': []}",[],,,english,0,2017-11-21T19:43:00.000+02:00,,"November 21, 2017 admin Politics 0 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration readied new sanctions Tuesday on North Korea, a day after declaring it a state sponsor of terrorism in a move to put additional pressure on Pyongyang’s nuclear program. North Korea has joined Iran, Sudan and Syria on America’s terror blacklist, a largely symbolic step as the administration already has the authority to impose virtually any sanctions it wants on Kim Jong Un’s government over its nuclear weapons development. As part of its “maximum pressure” campaign, President Donald Trump said the Treasury Department would impose more sanctions on North Korea and “related persons” starting Tuesday, without hinting who or what would be targeted. The move is part of rolling effort to deprive Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs and leave it internationally isolated. “It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it’s finished over a two-week period,” Trump said. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday the pressure campaign was starting to bite in Pyongyang, which is already facing unprecedented U.N.-mandated sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Tillerson said anecdotal evidence and intelligence suggests the North is now suffering fuel shortages, with queues at gas stations, and its revenues are down. The United States has been applying sanctions of its own as well. In Tokyo, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the move, telling reporters Japan supports the step as a way to increase pressure on North Korea. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang expressed concern. Lu said Tuesday that the situation is “highly sensitive” and that it would be “helpful to bring all parties back to the negotiation table instead of doing the opposite.” Da Zhigang, a North Korea expert at the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said the move “will arouse diplomatic reactions and hatred toward the U.S. from North Korea” and could even prompt the North to resume missile tests. An editorial Tuesday in North Korea’s ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called Trump a “heinous criminal” who had insulted the dignity of the country’s supreme leadership and its socialist system during his recent visit to South Korea. The editorial, carried by the state-run news agency, threatened “merciless punishment.” It did not mention the terror designation. In September, Trump opened the way for the U.S. to punish foreign companies dealing with North Korea. He issued an executive order expanding the Treasury Department’s ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with the North, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system. Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow on Northeast Asia at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Treasury could be preparing more designations against North Korean entities related to the terrorism listing, or possibly Chinese or other companies violating the September order. A potential target would be Chinese banks that serve as North Korea’s conduit to the international system. Such a move would irk Beijing, whose help Trump is counting on to put an economic squeeze on Pyongyang. China recently sent its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years to discuss the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula. Tillerson urged China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea’s external trade, to take unilateral steps to cut fuel supplies to its wayward neighbor. China, which is calling for dialogue to ease the nuclear tensions, is reluctant to exert economic pressure that could destabilize the North. Tillerson acknowledged a two-month pause in the North’s rapid tempo of nuclear and missile tests and said there was still hope for diplomacy. With tougher sanctions in the offing, he warned Kim, “This is only going to get worse until you’re ready to come and talk.” The terror designation, however, is likely to exacerbate sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim. North Korea shows no interest in talks aimed at getting it to give up its nukes. North Korea has been on and off the terror list over the years. It was designated for two decades because of its involvement in international terror attacks in the 1980s, then taken off in 2008 to smooth the way for nuclear talks that soon failed.","{'uuid': 'c3dc6cae79a544392360a1a967d22874f460c198', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47X73shvP4z7Dt7QtmFbdjU3nKLjP8FIJfB4CfSzP4SlKJqYLqpoTuSage.csyvcbntfq6R1IKM8VWlUO6cqEyvZczpIRhxmjwxq55uZKjZxseIRbmRJNkN', 'site_full': 'livenewscentral.com', 'site': 'livenewscentral.com', 'site_section': 'http://livenewscentral.com/feed', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'Livenewscentral', 'title': 'US readies new sanctions against North Korea, individuals', 'title_full': 'US readies new sanctions against North Korea, individuals', 'published': '2017-11-21T19:43:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/hosted.ap.org/MAI/AOL2183-2017-11-21T1156Z/E/prod/AT/A', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': None, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}","US readies new sanctions against North Korea, individuals",http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47X73shvP4z7Dt7QtmFbdjU3nKLjP8FIJfB4CfSzP4SlKJqYLqpoTuSage.csyvcbntfq6R1IKM8VWlUO6cqEyvZczpIRhxmjwxq55uZKjZxseIRbmRJNkN,c3dc6cae79a544392360a1a967d22874f460c198

By RYAN NAKASHIMA and MICHAEL LIEDTKEAP Technology Writers 
MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) - The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission followed through Tuesday on a pledge to scrap rules around open internet access, allowing giant cable and telecom companies to throttle broadband speeds and favor their own services if they wish. 
Ajit Pai sought to repeal ""net neutrality"" regulations enacted under the Obama administration. The current rules treat internet service providers such as Comcast, AT&T and Verizon as if they were utility companies that provide essential services, like electricity. The rules mandate that they give equal access to all online content and apps. 
Pai said those rules discourage investments that could provide even better and faster online access. Instead, he said new rules would force ISPs to be transparent about their services and management policies, and then would let the market decide. 
""Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,"" Pai said in a statement. 
Pai distributed his alternative plan to other FCC commissioners Tuesday in preparation for a Dec. 14 vote. Pai promised to release his entire proposal Wednesday. Although the FCC's two Democrats said they will oppose the proposal, the repeal is likely to prevail as Republicans dominate 3-2. The vote for net neutrality in 2015 was also along party lines, but Democrats dominated then. 
Equal treatment for all web traffic has been a fundamental principle of the internet since its creation but companies have increasingly put their thumb on the scales of access. AT&T, for example, doesn't count use of its streaming service DirecTV Now against wireless data caps, potentially making it seem cheaper to its cellphone customers than rival TV services. Rivals would have to pay AT&T for that privilege. 
Regulators, consumer advocates and some tech companies are concerned that repealing net neutrality will give ISPs even more power to block or slow down rival offerings. 
A repeal also opens the ability for ISPs to charge a company like Netflix for a faster path to its customers. Allowing this paid-priority market to exist could skew prices and create winners and losers among fledgling companies that require a high-speed connection to end users. 
Pai, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, said in an interview on Fox News Radio that Trump did not have any input on his proposal. Asked whether deregulation would result in higher prices and put speedy internet access out of the reach of blue-collar Americans, Pai said ""it's going to mean exactly the opposite."" 
""These heavy-handed regulations have made it harder for the private sector to build out the networks especially in rural America,"" Pai said. 
In a Wall Street Journal editorial published Tuesday, Pai cited a report by a nonprofit think tank, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, that said investment by the dozen largest ISPs fell about 2 percent from 2015 to 2016, to $61 billion. The group didn't link the drop solely to the stiffer rules introduced in 2015. 
The attempt to repeal net neutrality has triggered protests from consumer groups and internet companies. A data firm called Emprata that was backed by a telecom industry group found in August that after filtering out form letters, the overwhelming majority of comments to the FCC - about 1.8 million - favored net neutrality, compared with just 24,000 who supported its repeal. 
Carmen Scurato, director of policy and legal affairs for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said ISPs' ability to impose monthly caps on data use already act to raise prices and limit access. Repealing net neutrality, she said, ""is just erecting more barriers."" 
Among those that will be hit hardest are startups that depend on high-speed internet connections for growth, said Colin Angle, co-founder and CEO of iRobot, maker of the Roomba robot vacuum cleaners. He said his own company wouldn't be dramatically affected in the near term, but the nascent robotics industry overall might. 
""The need for these robots to consume bandwidth is certainly on the rise,"" Angle said. 
Google said in a statement that net neutrality rules ""are working well for consumers and we're disappointed in the proposal announced today."" 
Other tech companies were more muted, with some referring instead to their trade group, the Internet Association. Netflix, which had been vocal in support of the rules in 2015, tweeted that it ""supports strong #NetNeutrality"" and opposes the rules rollback. 
But the streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere. 
AT&T executive vice president Joan Marsh said new rules requiring ISPs to disclose their management practices will keep them honest. ""Any ISP that is so foolish as to seek to engage in gatekeeping will be quickly and decisively called out,"" she said in a statement. 
Comcast said its commitment to consumers will remain the same. ""We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content,"" Comcast's senior executive vice president David Cohen said. 
Pai's plan also restores the Federal Trade Commission as the main watchdog to protect consumers and promote competition. 
But Democratic Commissioner Mignon L. Clyburn said the proposal was ""a giveaway to the nation's largest communications companies."" 
Pai's proposal on net neutrality comes after the Republican-dominated commission voted 3-2 last week to weaken rules meant to support independent local media, undoing a ban on companies owning newspapers and broadcast stations in a single market.

Judge Richard Leon, a senior judge on the District of Columbia District Court, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, was assigned to the case after it was initially allotted to Judge Christopher Cooper, an Obama administration appointee. 
Judges for antitrust cases are selected randomly. No explanation was given as to why the case was reassigned. Republican-appointed judges are generally, but not always, more business-friendly than those appointed by Democrats.
Shares of Time Warner added to gains after Leon's selection, and were trading up 2.5 percent at $89.86 at midday, signaling that investors believe the deal has a better chance of being approved. 
The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday sued AT&T arguing that the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier would use Time Warner's content to force rival pay-TV companies to pay ""hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner's networks.""
AT&T has vowed to defend the $85.4 billion deal.
The Department of Justice's move to block it was ""foolish"" because the deal posed no threat to consumers, the wireless carrier's trial lawyer Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday.
""We want to go to court as soon as possible,"" Petrocelli told CNBC, saying the burden of proof was on the government. 
AT&T will ask the court for an expedited trial next week, a source familiar with case said. 
The Justice Department has not successfully litigated to stop a vertical deal - where the merging companies are not direct competitors, as is the case with AT&T and Time Warner - since the 1970s, when it prevented Ford Motor Co from buying assets from spark-plug maker Autolite.
The case will be closely watched because U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner's CNN, and opposed AT&T's purchase of Time Warner on the campaign trail last year, saying it would concentrate too much power in AT&T's hands.

The Associated Press 
NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are on the verge of more records Tuesday as most industries, including technology and health care companies, post solid gains. Solid quarterly reports are boosting companies including medical device maker Medtronic and construction services company Jacobs Engineering, while Signet Jewelers is tumbling.
KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,598 as of 3:40 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 153 points, or 0.7 percent, to 23,584. The Nasdaq composite added 65 points, or 1 percent, to 6,856. All three indexes are on track to break the records they set earlier this month. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose for a fourth day and picked up 12 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,515. That's above its record close from early October.
FOLLOW THE LEADERS: Big-name technology companies lead the way. Apple rose $2.88, or 1.7 percent, to $172.86 and Microsoft advanced $1.23, or 1.5 percent, to $83.77 while Facebook added $2.67, or 1.5 percent, to $181.41. Health care companies climbed as well. Those two sectors are the best-performing parts of the market this year. Basic materials companies, which have done better than the rest of the S&P 500, also rose.
High-dividend stocks like utilities lagged the market and telecommunications companies took small losses. They are considered safer, more stable investments that do better when investors expect market turbulence.
WHAT'S NEXT: The tech giants have made huge gains this year, and JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said that's not about to stop.
""They're seeing better earnings, better sales, better growth,"" he said. ""It's difficult to argue with that.""
Investors were cheered Tuesday by a report from Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin, who forecast that the S&P 500 will rise about 14 percent in 2018 if Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump are successful in cutting corporate taxes. Kostin said continued economic growth and lower taxes should help the S&P 500 rise to 3,100 by the end of 2020.
HEART BEAT: Medical device company Medtronic jumped after it posted profit that was larger than analysts had expected. The company said sales of heart devices including newer devices like its CoreValve Evolut Pro heart valve, drove its sales higher in the fiscal second quarter. The stock rose $3.89, or 4.9 percent, to $82.80.
HIGH RISE: Home builders climbed after the National Association of Realtors said sales of homes grew in October. They're down slightly from last year because there are so few houses on the market, but the tight supply and rising prices has sent home builder stocks soaring this year. On Tuesday, NVR advanced $45.89, or 1.4 percent, to $3,363.20, while D.R. Horton gained $1.03, or 2.1 percent, to $49.23 and Lennar rose $1.24, or 2.1 percent, to $60.36.
TARNISHED: Signet Jewelers plunged $22.50, or 29.7 percent, to $53.33 after the company slashed its annual forecast. The company recently sold its highest-quality loans to Alliance Data Systems, but the company said ""disruptions"" related to that move have affected sales, especially for its Kay brand.
Alliance Data Systems fell 88 cents to $223.79. Aaron's, which is running a lease-payment program for other Signet customers, fell 60 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $36.14.
BUILDING UP: Construction and technical services company Jacobs Engineering had a stronger fourth quarter than analysts expected. Its shares added $5.05, or 8.5 percent, to $64.39.
THEY DO LIKE SPAM: Food maker Hormel climbed after its quarterly profit and sales came out ahead of Wall Street projections. So did the company's forecasts for the rest of the year. The stock climbed $1.01, or 3 percent, to $34.41.
NUTS TO SOUP: Campbell Soup's profit and sales both fell a bit short of analysts' forecasts. The company reported a 9 percent drop in soup revenue and said carrot costs increased. It also faced greater logistics costs in the aftermath of the hurricanes. The stock shed $4.13, or 8.3 percent, to $45.80.
BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.36 percent from 2.37 percent.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $56.84 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, the international standard, added 35 cents to $62.57 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline climbed 3 cents to $1.77 a gallon. Heating oil was little changed at $1.94 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 3 cents to $3.02 per 1,000 cubic feet.
METALS: Gold rose $6.40 to $1,281.70 an ounce. Silver added 12 cents to $16.96 an ounce. Both metals had taken sharp losses Monday. Copper rose 4 cents to $3.13 a pound.
CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 112.44 yen from 112.67 yen. The euro rose to $1.1742 from $1.1732.
OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX gained 0.8 percent and the CAC 40 of France CAC 40 rose 0.5 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain rose 0.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.7 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.1 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 1.9 percent, its biggest gain in two months.","{'uuid': '6d00017910d549d16373ffa4ef81f45cc3ba5cf9', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROWjYmaxKpXA_QZsjs29VAChjpWC9un9_w8ArXC2ZKoDFkfPQLfuSIB0AxzTFM8ot0jPSXy9SHNCnriwvjG4zbOkcYZ.zbqGPIoIcaPwAuyHk', 'site_full': 'www.telegram.com', 'site': 'telegram.com', 'site_section': 'http://www.telegram.com/business?template=rss&mime=xml', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'Business - telegram.com', 'title': 'Tech gains, solid earnings push stocks higher', 'title_full': 'Tech gains, solid earnings push stocks higher - News - telegram.com - Worcester, MA', 'published': '2017-11-21T19:04:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'http://www.telegram.com/storyimage/WT/20171121/NEWS/171129865/AR/0/AR-171129865.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 31582, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}","Tech gains, solid earnings push stocks higher",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROWjYmaxKpXA_QZsjs29VAChjpWC9un9_w8ArXC2ZKoDFkfPQLfuSIB0AxzTFM8ot0jPSXy9SHNCnriwvjG4zbOkcYZ.zbqGPIoIcaPwAuyHk,6d00017910d549d16373ffa4ef81f45cc3ba5cf9

Judge Richard Leon, a senior judge on the District of Columbia District Court, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, was assigned to the case after it was initially allotted to Judge Christopher Cooper, an Obama administration appointee. 
Judges for antitrust cases are selected randomly. No explanation was given as to why the case was reassigned. Republican-appointed judges are generally, but not always, more business-friendly than those appointed by Democrats.
Shares of Time Warner added to gains after Leon's selection, and were trading up 2.5 percent at $89.86 at midday, signaling that investors believe the deal has a better chance of being approved. 
The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday sued AT&T arguing that the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier would use Time Warner's content to force rival pay-TV companies to pay ""hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner's networks.""
AT&T has vowed to defend the $85.4 billion deal.
The Department of Justice's move to block it was ""foolish"" because the deal posed no threat to consumers, the wireless carrier's trial lawyer Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday.
""We want to go to court as soon as possible,"" Petrocelli told CNBC, saying the burden of proof was on the government. 
AT&T will ask the court for an expedited trial next week, a source familiar with case said. 
The Justice Department has not successfully litigated to stop a vertical deal - where the merging companies are not direct competitors, as is the case with AT&T and Time Warner - since the 1970s, when it prevented Ford Motor Co from buying assets from spark-plug maker Autolite.

The order, proposed in May, would roll back the Barack Obama administration’s classification of internet service providers as “common carriers” under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.
As common carriers, internet providers are required to act as neutral gateways to the internet. In other words, companies like Comcast are not allowed to speed up or slow down content passing through their networks.
If the order passes, ISPs will be reclassified as “information service” providers, as they were between February 1996 and February 2015.
For almost twenty years, the Internet thrived under the light-touch regulatory approach established by President Clinton and a Republican Congress. This bipartisan framework led the private sector to invest $1.5 trillion building communications networks throughout the United States. And it gave us an Internet economy that became the envy of the world.
Apple and dozens of other large technology companies urged the FCC to reconsider its proposal. The FCC also received a record-breaking 22 million comments from the public during a feedback period that ended in August.
Those against the order believe that the FCC rolling back the internet’s classification as a public utility will hurt net neutrality, as it could eventually divide internet users into so-called “fast lanes” and “slow lanes.”
In a letter submitted to the FCC in August, Apple warned that paid fast lanes could result in an “internet with distorted competition.”
Broadband providers should not create paid fast lanes on the internet. Lifting the current ban on paid prioritization arrangements could allow broadband providers to favor the transmission of one provider’s content or services (or the broadband provider’s own online content or services) over other online content, fundamentally altering the internet as we know it today—to the detriment of consumers, competition, and innovation.
Pai, who was designated as FCC chairman by Donald Trump, insists the Obama-era internet regulations are a “mistake.” Under the new rules, he said the FCC will “stop micromanaging the internet” to foster innovation.
Today, I have shared with my colleagues a draft order that would abandon this failed approach and return to the longstanding consensus that served consumers well for decades. Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet. Instead, the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.
Despite the significant backlash from tech companies and the public, it is widely expected that the FCC will vote in favor of the order next month.

With markets climbing to record highs Tuesday, three investing powerhouses await changes in the market and economy. Warren Buffett ( Trades , Portfolio ), Seth Klarman ( Trades , Portfolio ) and Prem Watsa ( Trades , Portfolio ) each have amassed huge cash stockpiles ready to deploy when better deals emerge. Peter Lynch Chart of ALR 
Warren Buffett ( Trades , Portfolio ), CEO of massive conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE:BRK.A )( NYSE:BRK.B ), claims the largest coffers of the three. Cash on the company’s balance sheet, which Buffett uses to make giant purchases, topped records this year, amounting to around $100 billion. 
According to him, he has allowed the mountain to grow not because of pessimism about markets but due to the lack of big, quality deals a heady market has afforded. Because of the immense size of Berkshire, Buffett must make accordingly large deals to “move the needle.” 
In May, Buffett told CNBC that he hated cash, calling it ""a holding position until you find something else."" 
""Buffett prefers a 7 year pay back period, which is about 14 percent return on investment, so a $50 billion dollar acquisition would need to return $7.15 billion every year,"" Adam Parris, founder and educator at Searching for Value, said. ""So the question to ask is what company is trading with a market in excess of $50 billion that meets his investment criteria and will deliver him in-excess of $7.15 billion per year?"" 
Berkshire, which can pay hard cash for companies, has also been at a disadvantage to other players who borrow cheap money due to low interest rates, he said in the same interview. 
In a rare event, Buffett lost in a bid to buy Texas power company Oncor for $9 billion after Sempra Energy foiled his plan with an offer $450 million higher in August. 
At least some of the money has flowed into common stocks, but it slowed to a trickle in the third quarter. He or one of his deputy investors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, added only to stakes in Synchrony Financial (SYF), Monsanto Co. (MON) and Apple (APPL), increasing neither by more than 20%. It marked a change for Apple, though, where he poured money for the past three quarters and made it a “big-four” position in early 2017. 
""I strongly believe that Buffett will sit on it for a prolonged period of time,"" Paul Koger, head trader of Foxy Trades said. ""He has firmly stated that the markets are priced at levels that are beyond reasonable valuations. And as his main strategy is to find $1 bills being sold for 50 cents, there aren't many lying around these days."" 
Seth Klarman ( Trades , Portfolio ) 
The author of the cult classic book, “Margin of Safety,” famed value investor Seth Klarman ( Trades , Portfolio ) buys stocks trading at a discount from their intrinsic value, providing a cushion for any price declines. Fully valued stocks hold little appeal for the Baupost Group investor. 
According to Business Insider , the guru, who keeps a low media profile, also has roughly 40% of its assets in cash as of the end of the third quarter. 
Klarman shed four positions from his $8 billion portfolio in the third quarter, including a sizable holding of Qualcomm (QCOM) that represented 3.3% of the long positions. 
Of his 10 purchases during the quarter, most were from the healthcare industry, the third best-performing of the year with a 17.35% rise. The most represented in the portfolio is energy, the worst performing. Roughly 23% of the long positions in the portfolio were in energy, which declined 10.7% -- the only S&P 500 sector in negative territory year to date. The broader S&P 500 index has gained 15.3%. 
Klarman also continued purchasing stocks, buying four and adding to seven existing holdings. His largest positions in the third quarter were medical distribution company McKesson Corp. and entertainment company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC). 
Prem Watsa ( Trades , Portfolio ) 
Prem Watsa ( Trades , Portfolio ), head of insurance conglomerate Fairfax Financial ( TSX:FFH ), has also amassed a fortune to spend in case a “hard market” develops, he said in a recent conference call. 
Watsa’s outlook has improved since the election of President Donald Trump in November, before which he had fully hedged his portfolio for years. 
“But we continue to think the new administration’s policies may make this a stock picker’s market,” Watsa said on the call. 
Watsa also has $17 billion ready to deploy and 43% of his portfolio in cash ready for future opportunities. The investing giant said that after playing defense for years, it is ready to play offense. At the same time, Watsa did not rule out the usefulness of the cash should volatility return to markets next year. 
""Fairfax expects to have an excellent year in 2017 in spite of the catastrophe losses, with cash and marketable securities at record levels - and we are prepared if a hard market develops in 2018,"" he said in a release. 
In the third quarter, Watsa started 19 new positions, a radical shift from the previous quarter, when he bought no stocks and added to only two holdings. His biggest picks were Alere Inc. ( NYSE:ALR ), Chicago Bridge & Iron ( NYSE:CBI ) and Cray Inc. ( NASDAQ:CRAY ).

Photo: AP Washington: The chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission (US FCC) on Tuesday unveiled plans to repeal a landmark 2015 order that barred internet service providers from blocking or slowing down consumer access to web content, and said the regulator will prevent states and cities from adopting similar protections.
US FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a 14 December meeting on rescinding the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities.
With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama.
“The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet.
“We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added.
The net neutrality rules, aimed at giving consumers equal access to web content, also forbade broadband providers from charging consumers more for certain content, a practice called “paid prioritization.”
Pai said state and local governments “need to be preempted” from imposing their own net neutrality rules because broadband internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content.
The FCC’s planned action represents a victory for internet service providers including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, which had urged the FCC to revoke the rules. The companies have said that repealing the could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing.
In July, a group representing major technology firms including Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc had urged Pai to drop plans to rescind the rules.
At the December meeting, the FCC will vote on Pai’s proposal to require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate paid prioritization. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said.
The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies.
A federal appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by a telecommunications industry trade association.
‘GONE FOR GOOD’
The FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Many Democrats and some internet firms argue that without the rules, internet providers will threaten the openness of the internet.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter, “The internet is the public square of the 21st century. Unless we all speak out against the @FCC’s efforts to gut #netneutrality, the free and open internet we know today could be gone for good.”
The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump, a businessman-turned-politician, took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law.
The new order will reclassify internet providers as “information services” rather than a “telecommunication service,” which means the FCC has significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct.
Pai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since taking over as chairman, is mounting a broad deregulatory agenda and has pledged to take a “weed whacker” to unneeded regulations. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo the order by White House officials.
Pai said the FCC is adopting a “market-based deregulatory approach.” The FCC also will vote to eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gives the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit any internet service provider practice that it believes violates a long list of factors and sought to address future discriminatory conduct.
Pai said his goal is to use a “light-touch market-based” regulatory approach, arguing the internet operated well before the rules were adopted in 2015. The internet “is the greatest free market innovation in history,” Pai said, adding that government regulations could hinder that. (Reporting by David Shepardson)

By MATTHEW PENNINGTONAssociated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration readied new sanctions Tuesday on North Korea, a day after declaring it a state sponsor of terrorism in a move to put additional pressure on Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
North Korea has joined Iran, Sudan and Syria on America's terror blacklist, a largely symbolic step as the administration already has the authority to impose virtually any sanctions it wants on Kim Jong Un's government over its nuclear weapons development. 
As part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign, President Donald Trump said the Treasury Department would impose more sanctions on North Korea and ""related persons"" starting Tuesday, without hinting who or what would be targeted. The move is part of rolling effort to deprive Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs and leave it internationally isolated. 
""It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it's finished over a two-week period,"" Trump said. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday the pressure campaign was starting to bite in Pyongyang, which is already facing unprecedented U.N.-mandated sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Tillerson said anecdotal evidence and intelligence suggests the North is now suffering fuel shortages, with queues at gas stations, and its revenues are down. 
The United States has been applying sanctions of its own as well. 
In Tokyo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the move, telling reporters Japan supports the step as a way to increase pressure on North Korea. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang expressed concern. 
Lu said Tuesday that the situation is ""highly sensitive"" and that it would be ""helpful to bring all parties back to the negotiation table instead of doing the opposite."" 
Da Zhigang, a North Korea expert at the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said the move ""will arouse diplomatic reactions and hatred toward the U.S. from North Korea"" and could even prompt the North to resume missile tests. 
An editorial Tuesday in North Korea's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called Trump a ""heinous criminal"" who had insulted the dignity of the country's supreme leadership and its socialist system during his recent visit to South Korea. The editorial, carried by the state-run news agency, threatened ""merciless punishment."" It did not mention the terror designation. 
In September, Trump opened the way for the U.S. to punish foreign companies dealing with North Korea. He issued an executive order expanding the Treasury Department's ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with the North, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system. 
Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow on Northeast Asia at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Treasury could be preparing more designations against North Korean entities related to the terrorism listing, or possibly Chinese or other companies violating the September order. 
A potential target would be Chinese banks that serve as North Korea's conduit to the international system. Such a move would irk Beijing, whose help Trump is counting on to put an economic squeeze on Pyongyang. China recently sent its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years to discuss the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula. 
Tillerson urged China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's external trade, to take unilateral steps to cut fuel supplies to its wayward neighbor. China, which is calling for dialogue to ease the nuclear tensions, is reluctant to exert economic pressure that could destabilize the North. 
Tillerson acknowledged a two-month pause in the North's rapid tempo of nuclear and missile tests and said there was still hope for diplomacy. With tougher sanctions in the offing, he warned Kim, ""This is only going to get worse until you're ready to come and talk."" 
The terror designation, however, is likely to exacerbate sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim. North Korea shows no interest in talks aimed at getting it to give up its nukes. 
North Korea has been on and off the terror list over the years. It was designated for two decades because of its involvement in international terror attacks in the 1980s, then taken off in 2008 to smooth the way for nuclear talks that soon failed.

By NATALIYA VASILYEVA and BASSEM MROUEAssociated Press 
MOSCOW (AP) - On a surprise trip to Russia, Syria's Bashar Assad discussed potential new peace initiatives for post-war Syria with Russian President Vladimir Putin who declared that Russia's two-year military campaign in Syria is wrapping up, the Kremlin said Tuesday. 
Moscow released footage of Assad warmly embracing Putin, who hosted him in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Monday, ahead of a summit between Russia, Turkey and Iran and a new round of Syria peace talks in Geneva later this month. 
The meeting was unannounced and the Kremlin did not make it public until Tuesday morning. 
""I passed on to (Putin) and all Russian people our greetings and gratitude for all of the efforts that Russia made to save our country,"" Assad told Russia's top brass in televised remarks. 
Assad has only ventured outside his war-ravaged nation twice since the conflict began - both times to Russia. This week's visit to meet Putin is his second since the crisis began in March 2011 leading to a civil war that has killed some 400,000 people and resulted in millions of refugees. 
The first was in October 2015, weeks after Russia launched its military campaign in Syria to shore up Assad's forces, which turned the war in favor of Assad. 
The meeting in Sochi, which lasted three hours, preceded a summit between the presidents of Iran, Russia and Turkey set for Wednesday at the same venue. Iran and Russia have been Assad's main backers while Turkey supports the opposition. 
Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian president had previously assured the leaders of Turkey and Iran that ""Russia will work with Syrian leadership to prepare the groundwork for the understandings that could be reached in Sochi on Wednesday and to make sure that agreements that could be reached would be viable."" 
It wasn't immediately clear if the Kremlin put any pressure on Assad to accept a new deal brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran - or whether that deal would involve Assad staying on as president once the war is over - but Assad signaled his intention to hold his ground in future Syria peace talks. 
""We count on Russia's support to keep foreign players from interfering into the political process,"" he said during the talks with Putin. Assad is believed to have left Sochi after the meeting and returned to Damascus. 
Asked whether Putin and Assad have talked about the Syrian president's future in post-war Syria, Peskov said ""possible options for political settlement have been discussed"" and added that ""only the Syrian people could determine Assad's role."" 
Despite pressure from other nations that Assad step down, Moscow has insisted that it is up to the Syrian people to vote him in or out. 
Putin later called President Donald Trump to inform him about the talks with Assad, emphasizing that the Syrian leader said he would abide by a political settlement for Syria, including constitutional reform and the holding of parliamentary and presidential elections. 
Putin also called Saudi King Salman to inform him of the main issues on the agenda of the Russia-Turkey-Iran talks on Wednesday. They also discussed ""long-term prospects for a Syrian settlement,"" according to the Kremlin. Putin noted that Syria talks planned in Sochi and a meeting of Syrian opposition in Riyadh should help future talks in Geneva. 
The Russian leader also later phoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to brief them on the talks with Assad and the planned trilateral meeting. 
To prepare for Wednesday's mini-summit, military chiefs of Russia, Turkey and Iran met in Sochi on Tuesday and agreed to coordinate their efforts in Syria. 
Russia's defense ministry said the military chiefs discussed ""concrete steps to complete the elimination of the remaining IS and Nusra Front formations"" in Syria, referring to Islamic State fighters and Syria's al-Qaida affiliate as it was formerly known. The three also agreed to improve coordination in a safety zone in Syria's northwestern Idlib province. 
Russia, Turkey and Iran earlier this year brokered a truce between Syria's government and the rebels in four areas, including in Idlib. 
On Sunday, Syrian troops and their allies captured the eastern town of Boukamal, the last major urban area held by the Islamic State group in Syria, leaving the militants to defend just strips of desert territory and a besieged pocket outside Damascus. 
With the Syrian government controlling most of the country and Islamic State fighters in disarray, Putin said during the talks with Assad that Russia's military campaign in Syria is wrapping up - though he made no mention of the Russian presence in Syria, which Moscow is not likely to give up. 
""As for our joint work to fight terrorists in Syria, this military operation is coming to an end,"" he told Assad in televised remarks. ""I note with pleasure your willingness to work with everyone who wants peace and settlement."" 
Gen. Ret. Viktor Bondarev, former Russian air force chief who heads the defense affairs committee in the upper house of Russia's parliament, was quoted by the Tass news agency as saying that the military will keep its warplanes, as well as some ground troops and weapons in Syria. 
Russia has used the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's province of Latakia as the main hub for its campaign. It also has a naval supply facility in Tartus, which it plans to expand into a full-fledged naval base. 
Putin declared in March 2016 that Moscow will scale down its presence in Syria, but the Russian military has remained heavily involved in the conflict. 
Russian television showed footage of Putin and Assad entering a meeting with the top brass of Russia's defense ministry and the General Staff. 
""I asked the Syrian president to stop by,"" Putin told the Russian generals. He then referred to Assad and said: ""I would like to introduce you to people who played a key role in saving Syria.""

A többi között Tottenham–Dortmund rangadót rendeznek, de pályára lép a Manchester City is, míg a Real Madrid bebiztosíthatja továbbjutását. 
Matematikailag is bebiztosíthatja a csoportból való továbbjutást a Real Madrid. Az idei szezonban bukdácsoló címvédő a Sallai Rolandot is soraiban tudó ciprusi APOEL-hez látogat. 
„Az APOEL egy jó csapat. Nem követem minden meccsüket, de mint mindig, most is felkészültünk az ellenfélből. Megérdemlik, hogy a Bajnokok Ligájában szerepeljenek, a Bernabeuban is remekül játszottak” – mondta Zinedine Zidane, a Real Madrid vezetőedzője. 
A csoport másik mérkőzésén a már biztos továbbjutó Tottenham a Dortmundhoz látogat. 
„Jelenleg jól érezzük magunkat, hiszen jól teljesítünk. A mai egy jó mérkőzés lesz. Egy nagyon jó csapat otthonába látogatunk, de megpróbálunk nyerni. Célunk, hogy megtartsuk első helyünket ebben a rendkívül erős csoportban” – mondta Mauricio Pocetthino, az angol gárda szakvezetője. 
A Dortmund számára kötelező a győzelem, ha életben akarják tartani továbbjutási reményeiket. 
„A Tottenham egy erős csapat, erről mi is megbizonyosodtunk. Szerintem az emberek úgy gondolják, hogy nem tudunk nyerni ma este, mivel jelenleg nem vagyunk túl jó passzban. Lehetőségünk van rá, hogy rácáfoljunk ezekre a véleményekre egy jó csapat ellen. Ez a meccs egy jó lehetőség arra, hogy kimásszunk a gödörből” – mondta Peter Bosz, a Dortmund trénere.

A diplomáciai pengeváltás hátterében az áll, hogy az orosz–ukrán konfliktusban Fehéroroszország az oroszok mellé állt. 
A fehérorosz belbiztonsági szolgálat által közzétett videón egy férfi elhurcolása látható. A felvétel állítólag októberben készült, főszereplője pedig Pavlo Sarojko ukrán újságíró, akit a helyi KGB vett őrizetbe. A férfi arca nem látható a videón. hirdetés hirdetés hirdetés 
Pavlo Sarojko kémhálózatot szervezett fehérorosz állampolgárok részvételével, akik anyagi ellenszolgáltatás fejében katonai és politikai területről információkat gyűjtöttek – mondta a fehérorosz elhárítás vezetője, Dmitrij Pobiarzsin. 
Hozzátette, hogy Sarojkót előzetes letartóztatásba helyezték. Az ukrán újságíró azt vallotta, hogy az ukrán nagykövetség hírszerzési részlegének irányítása alatt dolgozott. Ukrajna tagadja, hogy kémkedett Fehéroroszországban. 
A Nyugaton csak Európa utolsó diktatúrájaként emlegetett Fehéroroszország és Ukrajna kapcsolata fokozatosan mérgesedett el. Alekszandr Lukasenko fehérorosz elnök rendszerét az olcsó orosz energiaszállítások tartják életben, és Lukasenko az orosz–ukrán konfliktusban is Ukrajna ellen foglalt állást. Adatvédelem

 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Moscow — On a surprise trip to Russia, Syria’s Bashar Assad discussed potential new peace initiatives for post-war Syria with Russian President Vladimir Putin who declared that Russia’s two-year military campaign in Syria is wrapping up, the Kremlin said Tuesday.
Moscow released footage of Assad warmly embracing Putin, who hosted him in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Monday, ahead of a summit between Russia, Turkey and Iran and a new round of Syria peace talks in Geneva later this month.
The meeting was unannounced and the Kremlin did not make it public until Tuesday morning.
“I passed on to (Putin) and all Russian people our greetings and gratitude for all of the efforts that Russia made to save our country,” Assad told Russia’s top brass in televised remarks.
Assad has only ventured outside his war-ravaged nation twice since the conflict began — both times to Russia. This week’s visit to meet Putin is his second since the crisis began in March 2011 leading to a civil war that has killed some 400,000 people and resulted in millions of refugees.
The first was in October 2015, weeks after Russia launched its military campaign in Syria to shore up Assad’s forces, which turned the war in favor of Assad.
The meeting in Sochi, which lasted three hours, preceded a summit between the presidents of Iran, Russia and Turkey set for Wednesday at the same venue. Iran and Russia have been Assad’s main backers while Turkey supports the opposition.
Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian president had previously assured the leaders of Turkey and Iran that “Russia will work with Syrian leadership to prepare the groundwork for the understandings that could be reached in Sochi on Wednesday and to make sure that agreements that could be reached would be viable.”
It wasn’t immediately clear if the Kremlin put any pressure on Assad to accept a new deal brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran — or whether that deal would involve Assad staying on as president once the war is over — but Assad signaled his intention to hold his ground in future Syria peace talks.
“We count on Russia’s support to keep foreign players from interfering into the political process,” he said during the talks with Putin. Assad is believed to have left Sochi after the meeting and returned to Damascus.
Asked whether Putin and Assad have talked about the Syrian president’s future in post-war Syria, Peskov said “possible options for political settlement have been discussed” and added that “only the Syrian people could determine Assad’s role.”
Despite pressure from other nations that Assad step down, Moscow has insisted that it is up to the Syrian people to vote him in or out.
Putin later called President Donald Trump to inform him about the talks with Assad, emphasizing that the Syrian leader said he would abide by a political settlement for Syria, including constitutional reform and the holding of parliamentary and presidential elections.
Putin also called Saudi King Salman to inform him of the main issues on the agenda of the Russia-Turkey-Iran talks on Wednesday. They also discussed “long-term prospects for a Syrian settlement,” according to the Kremlin. Putin noted that Syria talks planned in Sochi and a meeting of Syrian opposition in Riyadh should help future talks in Geneva.
To prepare for Wednesday’s mini-summit, military chiefs of Russia, Turkey and Iran met in Sochi on Tuesday and agreed to coordinate their efforts in Syria.
Russia’s defense ministry said the military chiefs discussed “concrete steps to complete the elimination of the remaining IS and Nusra Front formations” in Syria, referring to Islamic State fighters and Syria’s al-Qaida affiliate as it was formerly known. The three also agreed to improve coordination in a safety zone in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province.
Russia, Turkey and Iran earlier this year brokered a truce between Syria’s government and the rebels in four areas, including in Idlib.
On Sunday, Syrian troops and their allies captured the eastern town of Boukamal, the last major urban area held by the Islamic State group in Syria, leaving the militants to defend just strips of desert territory and a besieged pocket outside Damascus.
With the Syrian government controlling most of the country and Islamic State fighters in disarray, Putin said during the talks with Assad that Russia’s military campaign in Syria is wrapping up — though he made no mention of the Russian presence in Syria, which Moscow is not likely to give up.
“As for our joint work to fight terrorists in Syria, this military operation is coming to an end,” he told Assad in televised remarks. “I note with pleasure your willingness to work with everyone who wants peace and settlement.”
Gen. Ret. Viktor Bondarev, former Russian air force chief who heads the defense affairs committee in the upper house of Russia’s parliament, was Quote: d by the Tass news agency as saying that the military will keep its warplanes, as well as some ground troops and weapons in Syria.
Russia has used the Hemeimeem air base in Syria’s province of Latakia as the main hub for its campaign. It also has a naval supply facility in Tartus, which it plans to expand into a full-fledged naval base.
Putin declared in March 2016 that Moscow will scale down its presence in Syria, but the Russian military has remained heavily involved in the conflict.
Russian television showed footage of Putin and Assad entering a meeting with the top brass of Russia’s defense ministry and the General Staff.
“I asked the Syrian president to stop by,” Putin told the Russian generals. He then referred to Assad and said: “I would like to introduce you to people who played a key role in saving Syria.”","{'uuid': '852790dbe767e89ed02a36f5c617f7f83d81a9f7', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8geHjX9bYEbC1GnommKP6BSZO96X9AS_JIBd5WDhwlVjIPsi0kytF1RTTrnZe5mfkTah9j_rBvnGSWN24THaMLpI5HvTjlK9w-', 'site_full': 'www.detroitnews.com', 'site': 'detroitnews.com', 'site_section': 'http://rssfeeds.detroitnews.com/detroit/home', 'site_categories': ['real_estate', 'buying_selling_homes'], 'section_title': 'GANNETT Syndication Service', 'title': 'On Russia trip, Assad and Putin talk post-war Syria', 'title_full': 'On Russia trip, Assad and Putin talk post-war Syria', 'published': '2017-11-21T19:28:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc7afad1c146589a86d88a173e484cc1032cf6c7/c=0-290-3034-1997&r=x803&c=1600x800/local/-/media/2017/11/21/DetroitNews/B99601197Z.1_20171121122835_000_GM61OG21F.2-0.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 6888, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}","On Russia trip, Assad and Putin talk post-war Syria",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8geHjX9bYEbC1GnommKP6BSZO96X9AS_JIBd5WDhwlVjIPsi0kytF1RTTrnZe5mfkTah9j_rBvnGSWN24THaMLpI5HvTjlK9w-,852790dbe767e89ed02a36f5c617f7f83d81a9f7

Greg Abbott offered a $20,000 reward for tips about the “murder,” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz bemoaned the “ongoing threat that an unsecure border poses,” and President Donald Trump took to Twitter to push for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
“We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!” Trump wrote.
But the Border Patrol agents might not have been attacked after all. A federal official told the Associated Press that they may have instead fallen down a 14-foot culvert near Interstate 10 in Van Horn, and the Culberson County sheriff told The Dallas Morning News that investigators are looking into whether it was an accident.
The agent who died was Rogelio Martinez, 36. The second agent has not been named but reportedly has no memory of the incident.
Abbott did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether he will rescind the reward offer.
Although investigators have not offered details on the incident, the Border Patrol Council, the union for agents, has insisted that it was an attack. After reports emerged Tuesday questioning that narrative, union spokesman Chris Cabrera did not back down.
“My thought on this is there’s no way a fall from where they were at would have been consistent with the injuries they had. Their heads were beaten pretty badly with rocks or stones,” Cabrera told the American-Statesman. “For anybody to speculate and say that it was an accident, I can’t begin to think what they’re thinking. I don’t know what the purpose is.”","{'uuid': 'ae21a9e7372dcb9e434266a46f53fb8378f1932f', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg851a5pBzrUcKQSKKClvNkkuAY4d9mhsXhSlZF3kXNazxzCo4ZQyEk_x7zbL2yvbumCOGv32g2Iey0vtX._ErIKoFdblTz5yWXW1okJ_zL1wTvrIE0_1roD9a28zZoby3QA5kSv8WtVO.EP1qxq_DX7shRSbnxaPv_3rVGuj84lRinB1ZMQKeUl', 'site_full': 'www.statesman.com', 'site': 'statesman.com', 'site_section': 'http://www.statesman.com/news/', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'Latest news', 'title': 'Questions emerge about Border Patrol death', 'title_full': 'Questions emerge about Border Patrol death', 'published': '2017-11-21T19:55:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'http://www.statesman.com/rf/image_large/Pub/p8/Statesman/2017/11/21/Images/newsEngin.20506424_Harvey_Border_Wall_75007.jp.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 20079, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",Questions emerge about Border Patrol death,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg851a5pBzrUcKQSKKClvNkkuAY4d9mhsXhSlZF3kXNazxzCo4ZQyEk_x7zbL2yvbumCOGv32g2Iey0vtX._ErIKoFdblTz5yWXW1okJ_zL1wTvrIE0_1roD9a28zZoby3QA5kSv8WtVO.EP1qxq_DX7shRSbnxaPv_3rVGuj84lRinB1ZMQKeUl,ae21a9e7372dcb9e434266a46f53fb8378f1932f

By JOHN POMFRET | Special To The Washington Post | Published: November 21, 2017 This month, President Donald Trump threatened China with the prospect of a remilitarized Japan if Beijing did not do more to push North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programs. Calling Japan a “warrior nation,” Trump noted in an interview that he had warned China “you’re going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea.” But are the Japanese nascent “warriors”? Is the scourge of resurgent militarism about to reinfect the Land of the Rising Sun? The answer to both questions is no. Although moves are afoot in Japan to turn its Self-Defense Forces into something approaching a normal military, the idea that Japan risks a return to a “warrior nation” is ludicrous. Indeed, there remains a vast gap between the Japan of today and a Japan that might be able to defend itself. Grant Newsham says the biggest problem on the path to military reform is Japan’s “pathological dependence” on the United States for its security. Newsham should know. As a colonel in the Marine Corps, he served as a liaison officer to Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Force. “The Japanese like to say, ‘The Americans are the spear and we’re the shield,’ ” Newsham said. “Well, in battle, the spear gets bloodied and the shield doesn’t. It’s the Americans who are expected to do the dying on Japan’s behalf.” Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has pushed his country to accept more responsibility for its own defense. In 2015, he backed a set of laws that made it possible for the Self-Defense Forces to come to the aid of its friends. Before that, Japan could be defended by the United States, but it could not return the favor. Abe now wants to revise Japan’s pacifist constitution — not so Japanese forces can attack other countries, as some alarmists have warned, but rather to give legal standing to the Self-Defense Forces. Most of the constitution’s Article 9, which prohibits Japan from waging war and obtaining “war potential,” would stay intact. But even this modest change would demand the support of two-thirds of the Japanese parliament, so it’s unclear whether Abe can get it passed. Even if he does, Japan’s military would still require urgent reform. Right now its military services — its air force, navy and ground troops — can barely work together, operating instead like warring fiefdoms. They do not even possess radios that can talk to each other. In Japan, Trump urged Japan to buy “a lot of military equipment from the United States.” But as Newsham noted, “You can buy all the F-35s you want, but if every service does what it wants, you’re not going to be able to accomplish anything.” Newsham has been involved in an effort to help Japan develop an amphibious capability, essentially a backdoor effort to force Japan’s ground forces to work with its navy. So far, it has yet to yield results. In fact, the lack of an amphibious capability hampered the military’s ability to save people stranded onshore after the Fukushima earthquake of 2011. “Navy ships could function offshore but it was impossible to do landings to save people,” Newsham recalled. Japan’s difficulties with “jointness” have also affected its military alliance with the United States. The exceptions are Japan’s navy, which has developed a close relationship with its American counterpart, and U.S.-Japanese cooperation on missile defense. But that’s a short list. After the Fukushima quake, Newsham recalled, U.S. Marines arrived in the region to conduct humanitarian operations. The Japanese army units stationed there had no idea who they were. Finally, in Japan, there remains little political support for a stronger military. For years, Japan’s media have poked fun at the Self-Defense Forces. The “Godzilla” movies of the 1960s portrayed Japanese troops as incompetent yokels who invariably fled in Godzilla’s wake. Those who join Japan’s all-volunteer military are still looked down on and the recruits are poorly paid. A rapidly aging society is also cutting into recruitment. The number of 18- to 26-year-olds — the ages eligible for SDF recruitment — has dropped 40 percent since 1994, according to the Ministry of Defense’s annual white paper in 2016. For years, each time a politician in Japan advocated military reform, he or she was lambasted as a warmonger, a fascist or a denier of Japan’s crimes during World War II. While this tendency has waned, Japanese voters remain reluctant to devote more resources to protecting their country. Japan currently spends $48 billion on defense, but Abe has shelved his vow to push defense expenditures over 1 percent of gross domestic product, much less the NATO target of 2 percent of GDP. If Japan were located in a peaceable region, its military challenges would not be a cause for concern. But Northeast Asia is one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on the globe. North Korea routinely fires rockets over Japanese airspace that splash into Japan’s territorial waters. China, which is in the midst of an ambitious program to reform its military and upgrade its weaponry, claims Japanese territory and routinely violates Japanese airspace and sea lanes. The alliance between the United States and Japan, which was signed in 1952, has lasted longer than any other alliance between two powers since the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Over the past two decades, successive American administrations have trumpeted its success. Trump was no different. “I don’t think we’ve ever been closer to Japan,” the president said during his trip to Tokyo. But as tensions rise in Asia, Japan is going to need to do more — both for itself and for its American friends.

That drew the attention of Trump, of course, who said the Oakland Raiders running back should be suspended.

— Delisa Lynch (@MommaLynch24) November 20, 2017 It’s funny, and also relevant. Plenty of people believe the attacks from Trump on the NFL date back to the mid-1980s, when Trump basically ruined the defunct USFL by pushing the spring league to compete with the NFL in the fall, as Trump hoped the NFL would absorb the New Jersey Generals team he owned. The USFL ended up suing the NFL in an antitrust lawsuit and won, though the USFL was awarded only $3 in damages and that killed the league. Delisa Lynch wasn’t the only one to take a shot at Trump. Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters, who, like Lynch, is from Oakland and is close to the Raiders star, said Trump should sit down with him and Lynch and talk. “Was going on big dog I know we got a lot that needs to be talk about how about we set up a (sit) down with you,me,@MoneyLynch and more and we talk about some (stuff),” Peters said in a reply to Trump’s tweet about Lynch , via the Kansas City Star . Peters has been protesting during the anthem this season as well, and the Star said Peters also tweeted that he wasn’t trying to be disrespectful and he really did want to talk to Trump. Trump has found that a lot of easy attention comes from ripping NFL players who are protesting during the anthem. Of all the players Trump could have singled out, Lynch will have plenty of supporters come back at him.

By ISHAAN THAROOR | The Washington Post | Published: November 21, 2017 In ancient times, the Romans referred to the land known as Yemen as “Arabia Felix,” or “Happy Arabia” — a country blessed with fertile, irrigated plains and busy ports where traders came in search of frankincense, ambergris and other prized commodities of antiquity. Now, of course, Yemen is far from happy. It has been ravaged by a yearslong civil war and a Saudi-led intervention in 2015 that has killed thousands of civilians during relentless airstrikes. The collapse of the impoverished country’s infrastructure has spawned a host of crises, ranging from the absence of clean water in a number of cities to financial ruin for the many Yemenis who have lost their livelihoods amid the war. An ongoing Saudi blockade of Yemeni ports risks worsening the food insecurity faced by about 17 million Yemenis — close to two-thirds of the nation’s population. Last week, the relief group Save the Children warned that hunger and disease could kill an estimated 50,000 Yemeni children under the age of 5 before year’s end — that’s an average of 130 children dying a day, one every 10 minutes. Humanitarian organizations warn of the risks created by both their funding shortfalls and the continued toll of the conflict. “We’re on the brink of famine,” said David Beasley, the head of the U.N.’s World Food Program, in an interview aired by “60 Minutes” over the weekend. “If we don’t receive the monies that we need in the next few months, I would say 125,000 little girls and boys will die.” Beasley went on: “We’ve been able to avert famine, but we know three things that are happening: We know that people are dying. We know that people are wasting. And we know that children are stunting. We have a stunting rate in Yemen now at almost 50 percent. That means they’re smaller, the brains are smaller, the body’s smaller because they’re not getting the food or the nutrition they need.” The prospect of famine dovetails with one of the worst outbreaks of cholera in recorded history, an epidemic that has killed more than 2,100 people over the past year. Aid agencies have worked fitfully to contain the disease, but they warn that a new outbreak is probable because of the chronic fuel shortages that have rendered sewage treatment plants and water-pumping facilities inoperable. “We should have peace,” a spokesman from the World Health Organization told CBS. “This is what we need to stop this epidemic.” But peace in Yemen is not at hand. The country’s civil war attracted global attention after rebels known as the Houthis captured the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014. The Houthis, a faction linked to the Zaydi sect of Shiite Islam, received limited support from Iran, the arch-nemesis of Saudi Arabia. By the spring of 2015, the Saudis and a coalition of Gulf Arab nations moved in to restore Yemen’s pro-Riyadh government. Despite a withering air campaign that has leveled the nation’s cities, they have been unable to break the Houthi rebellion, which still controls Sanaa and a sizable chunk of the north of the country. After an attempted Houthi missile strike on Riyadh was thwarted by Saudi forces this month, the kingdom escalated its rhetoric, accusing Iran of “direct aggression.” (Many analysts say that the Iranian connection to the Houthis is often overstated.) The Saudis then imposed a tighter blockade on Yemeni ports, supposedly to deprive the Houthis of weapons and goods supplied by Tehran. Humanitarian groups protested that it made the desperate humanitarian situation in Yemen even worse. “Before the civil war broke out, Yemen imported nearly 90 percent of its food, mostly by sea. Seven million Yemeni people rely entirely on imported food,” explained my Washington Post colleague Amanda Erickson. “Because of the fighting, importing food has become much more difficult. Many shipping companies simply won’t send supplies anymore. Even before the blockade, those who ship supplies could face massive delays and mandatory searches by coalition warships.” “I don’t think there’s any question the Saudi-led coalition, along with the Houthis and all of those involved, are using food as a weapon of war,” Beasley said. “And it’s disgraceful.” The Saudis said last week they were easing the blockade and have repeatedly pointed to the humanitarian relief work they themselves are carrying out in Yemen. But international officials still complain of the difficulty of access to the country. “Ongoing obstruction by the Saudi-led coalition to the delivery of critical supplies is a measure which may amount to collective punishment of millions of Yemeni people,” read a statement signed last week by a host of international organizations, including the United Nations, the International Rescue Committee and Save the Children. “It exacerbates the world’s worst humanitarian crisis where almost three years of war have left over twenty million people in need of assistance, seven million of them on the brink of famine.” Absent in the “60 Minutes” segment was any serious discussion of the American role in Yemen’s war. Both the Trump and Obama administrations backed the Saudi operation, committing ships to the region, sharing intelligence with Riyadh and resupplying the Saudi coalition with munitions. In his tweets this year, President Donald Trump has seemingly given the energetic Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, carte blanche in his mission to confront Iranian influence in the Middle East — no matter the many warnings of Washington’s foreign policy establishment that the young Saudi royal is in over his head. But in both the United States and Britain, which also has a deep security relationship with Riyadh, there is growing recognition of complicity in Yemen’s misery. Last week, the House of Representatives passed a largely symbolic bill stating that U.S. military assistance to the Saudis was not authorized by the same legislation that sanctions the long-standing American war on terrorist groups in the Middle East. For a rare moment, the tragedy in Yemen was debated on Capitol Hill. But that will be of little comfort to millions of Yemenis trapped in a world of fear, hunger and deprivation with no end in sight.

If you read only the New York Times or Wall Street Journal stories on the latest Jared Kushner correspondence—email subject line: “Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite”—you’d be missing an important piece of the puzzle. Other outlets, like NBC News which broke the story, did not miss the piece. They emphasized it. 
The key question here is whether any senior-level Trump campaign aide met with Aleksander Torshin, deputy head of Russia’s central bank and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, especially following the emails under scrutiny. 
This question is even more important since it implicates the defense that Kushner’s lawyers have staked out for his failure to turn over the emails to Congress. “Kushner’s lawyers said the committee never asked their client for records of proposed meetings that never happened – but the episode gave the impression Kushner had something to hide,” according to the Washington Post . 
According to all accounts, Torshin asked to meet a high-level Trump campaign official during the National Rifle Association annual convention in Louisville, Kentucky in May 2016. His purpose was apparently to pass on some information from Putin to Donald Trump and to see if the presidential candidate would meet with Putin at a later date. Kushner waived off top campaign aides like Rick Dearborn, saying “Pass on this,” and Kushner added, “Most likely these people then go back home and claim they have special access to gain importance for themselves.” 
According to the New York Times , however, “Mr. Torshin’s outreach fizzled”—though it is ambiguous whether the Times is referring to a meeting with Putin or simply Torshin’s attempt to meet with a top campaign official during the NRA convention. (I read it to mean the latter.) Here’s how the paper described the result of Torshin’s efforts: 
“Neither Mr. Trump nor his campaign officials attended the veterans’ dinner, Mr. Clay said. Donald Trump Jr. attended a separate dinner that night, hosted by the National Rifle Association, that Mr. Torshin also attended. Both dinners were in Louisville.” 
Similarly, the Wall Street Journal wrote: 
“ NBC News reported Friday that the Russia-linked individual in the email was Aleksander Torshin, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wanted to meet with a top Trump campaign official during a National Rifle Association convention and suggested he had a message for Mr. Trump from Mr. Putin. Mr. Torshin didn’t meet with Mr. Trump at the NRA convention but went to a dinner there that was also attended by Donald Trump Jr., Bloomberg has reported.” 
But NBC News and Bloomberg had reported one further step: Torshin said he met and had dinner with Don, Jr. that evening at an NRA side event. 
NBC News reported: 
“However, Torshin was seated with the candidate’s son , Donald Trump Jr., during a private dinner on the sidelines of a May 2016 NRA event during the convention in Louisville, according to an account Torshin gave to Bloomberg . Congressional investigators have no clear explanation for how that came to be, according to sources familiar with the matter. “ 
Torshin discussed the NRA dinner in an interview with Bloomberg in April 2017. Bloomberg wrote, “Torshin said in the interview he stayed clear of then-candidate Trump at last year’s N.R.A. event to avoid controversy, dining with Donald Trump Jr. instead.” 
Admittedly, Torshin’s statement is uncorroborated, and some may think that’s a reason for the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal not to print it. But really? Don’t reporters routinely print the statement of one side of an interaction if the person is willing to go on record, especially if the individual is a principal participant and thus it’s not second-hand information? What’s uncorroborated is whether the two were seated together at dinner. A “fact” in the record is that Torshin said they were. Readers would want to know Torshin said this, and they deserved to know it. 
The Bloomberg story in April also included a denial of Torshin’s statement, and that should be noted too. But even that denial acknowledged that the two men—Torshin and Don Jr.—did, in fact, meet at the NRA dinner, and not just by happenstance. They were introduced by a mutual contact. According to Bloomberg ’s April story: 
“A person familiar with the encounter disputed Torshin’s account, saying Trump Jr. recalls meeting a Russian that night but doesn’t recall if it was Torshin. When mutual acquaintances introduced the two men, the pair exchanged pleasantries, then the Russian sat at a table nearby, this person said.” 
In the past 24 hours additional media outlets are now reporting an on-the-record statement by Alan Futerfas, an attorney representing Don Jr., who admits the two men met through an “acquaintance” but says that “they made small talk for a few minutes and went back to their separate meals.” 
We may have not even wrestled that admission out of Don Jr. had the only reports been the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal . I understand reasons to be cautious in reporting information about potential contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians without sufficient support. This was not the occasion to hold back on what readers needed to know to reach their own views about the interactions and about Kushner’s decision to withhold the email exchange from Congress. 
It is also notable that news reports prior to the revelations of Kushner’s emails also included reference to Torshin’s dining with Don Jr.: 
“Torshin had fleeting contact with the future president, who only went so far as to shake his hand. With his son, Donald Trump Jr., things went further: he sat by his side during a private dinner in a restaurant in Kentucky.”","{'uuid': '94a8f0cda74e41628d8c169413c8cf7d6e39c17a', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQci4bpH2iKrCrkZGkTta0xSh7S5d2po78lpOAyvFwRQGt_JSGGRv8yIVsiNtluYxKX6e3JZghq6bmEM7DFRDZdLAcqNtP2HmKUhBIrqUQIcYOOf0SBnIlw', 'site_full': 'www.justsecurity.org', 'site': 'justsecurity.org', 'site_section': 'http://feed.informer.com/digests/LCXJ3MUAYS/feeder.atom', 'site_categories': ['politics', 'law_government_and_politics', 'legal_issues'], 'section_title': ""Mike Nova's Shared NewsLinks Review"", 'title': 'What You Could Not Learn from NYT and WSJ on Kushner’s “Russian Backdoor” Email', 'title_full': 'What You Could Not Learn from NYT and WSJ on Kushner’s “Russian Backdoor” Email', 'published': '2017-11-21T19:13:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Torshin-NRA-e1511280623547.jpeg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': None, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",What You Could Not Learn from NYT and WSJ on Kushner’s “Russian Backdoor” Email,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQci4bpH2iKrCrkZGkTta0xSh7S5d2po78lpOAyvFwRQGt_JSGGRv8yIVsiNtluYxKX6e3JZghq6bmEM7DFRDZdLAcqNtP2HmKUhBIrqUQIcYOOf0SBnIlw,94a8f0cda74e41628d8c169413c8cf7d6e39c17a

By MATTHEW PENNINGTONAssociated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration readied new sanctions Tuesday on North Korea, a day after declaring it a state sponsor of terrorism in a move to put additional pressure on Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
North Korea has joined Iran, Sudan and Syria on America's terror blacklist, a largely symbolic step as the administration already has the authority to impose virtually any sanctions it wants on Kim Jong Un's government over its nuclear weapons development. 
As part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign, President Donald Trump said the Treasury Department would impose more sanctions on North Korea and ""related persons"" starting Tuesday, without hinting who or what would be targeted. The move is part of rolling effort to deprive Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs and leave it internationally isolated. 
""It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it's finished over a two-week period,"" Trump said. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday the pressure campaign was starting to bite in Pyongyang, which is already facing unprecedented U.N.-mandated sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Tillerson said anecdotal evidence and intelligence suggests the North is now suffering fuel shortages, with queues at gas stations, and its revenues are down. 
The United States has been applying sanctions of its own as well. 
In Tokyo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the move, telling reporters Japan supports the step as a way to increase pressure on North Korea. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang expressed concern. 
Lu said Tuesday that the situation is ""highly sensitive"" and that it would be ""helpful to bring all parties back to the negotiation table instead of doing the opposite."" 
Da Zhigang, a North Korea expert at the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said the move ""will arouse diplomatic reactions and hatred toward the U.S. from North Korea"" and could even prompt the North to resume missile tests. 
An editorial Tuesday in North Korea's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called Trump a ""heinous criminal"" who had insulted the dignity of the country's supreme leadership and its socialist system during his recent visit to South Korea. The editorial, carried by the state-run news agency, threatened ""merciless punishment."" It did not mention the terror designation. 
In September, Trump opened the way for the U.S. to punish foreign companies dealing with North Korea. He issued an executive order expanding the Treasury Department's ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with the North, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system. 
Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow on Northeast Asia at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Treasury could be preparing more designations against North Korean entities related to the terrorism listing, or possibly Chinese or other companies violating the September order. 
A potential target would be Chinese banks that serve as North Korea's conduit to the international system. Such a move would irk Beijing, whose help Trump is counting on to put an economic squeeze on Pyongyang. China recently sent its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years to discuss the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula. 
Tillerson urged China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's external trade, to take unilateral steps to cut fuel supplies to its wayward neighbor. China, which is calling for dialogue to ease the nuclear tensions, is reluctant to exert economic pressure that could destabilize the North. 
Tillerson acknowledged a two-month pause in the North's rapid tempo of nuclear and missile tests and said there was still hope for diplomacy. With tougher sanctions in the offing, he warned Kim, ""This is only going to get worse until you're ready to come and talk."" 
The terror designation, however, is likely to exacerbate sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim. North Korea shows no interest in talks aimed at getting it to give up its nukes. 
North Korea has been on and off the terror list over the years. It was designated for two decades because of its involvement in international terror attacks in the 1980s, then taken off in 2008 to smooth the way for nuclear talks that soon failed.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — What makes a good presidential turkey? Showmanship. A readiness to strut his stuff and gobble on command, yet enough restraint to stay on a table for the big photo op. 
So say a Minnesota turkey farmer and 4-H kids who raised the turkey that will go to the White House for an official pardon from President Donald Trump on Tuesday. It’s the 70th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey tradition. Here’s a little deeper look at the event and what goes into it: 
THE TRADITION 
White House archives show that Americans have sent presidents holiday turkeys at least since 1873 under President Ulysses S. Grant. But the National Thanksgiving Turkey dates from 1947, when the National Turkey Federation became the official supplier and presented a 47-pound gobbler to President Harry Truman. In those days the turkeys were destined for dinner. 
Formal pardons began with President George H.W. Bush in 1989, though stories of spared turkeys date back to President Abraham Lincoln. President John F. Kennedy sent his 1963 turkey back to its farm. Sometime around the Nixon era the White House began sending them to petting zoos after the ceremonies, though without formal pardons. 
MINNESOTA’S GOBBLERS 
The perk of taking presidential turkeys to Washington goes to the chairman of the National Turkey Federation. This year that’s Carl Wittenburg, from the Minnesota town of Alexandria. 
Wittenburg recruited five Douglas County 4-H members to help. They’re the same teens he and his wife, Sharlene, mentored to a second-place finish in the statewide 4-H Science of Agriculture Challenge this summer with a project on turkey bedding. None of the girls had worked with turkeys before. Now they’re all going to the White House to help oversee the bird, though Wittenburg’s 19-year-old son, Wyatt, will lift it up onto the table. 
The Wittenburgs grow more than 100,000 turkeys annually for Northern Pride Cooperative in Wyndmere, North Dakota, but they raised the presidential flock on their smaller hobby farm near Alexandria. The birds hatched in late June. The star and an understudy who would step in if there’s a last-minute problem will be around 47 and 37 pounds respectively by pardoning time. 
THE CHALLENGES 
The goal is getting the turkeys used to people. Teaching them to stay on the table and behave is the key, said Katie Kent, 18. The birds are hand-fed grub worms as bribes. 
“We’re getting them used to being on that table and getting them to gobble and strut on command,” said Kodi Bundermann, 17. 
Strutting for a turkey means fanning out his tail feathers and puffing out his body feathers. Toms do it to look good to the hens, Wittenburg said. Gobbling also is a male behavior; females click or cluck. It’s hard to get turkeys to strut on command, he said, but they’ll gobble nine times out of 10. 
The 4-Hers also play them music. They seem to like country, said Christina Kuismi, 16. 
“They love anything shiny, or even the ends of shoelaces, which are a little shiny,” Kuismi said. “They like to untie shoelaces. They’ve gotten really good at it.” 
Another challenge for the ceremony is that turkeys are very easily distracted, she said. 
“They’re just very easily entertained,” she said. “They just want to go everywhere and see everything and explore.” 
THE STARS 
The team selected the two best birds from a flock of about 20, They looked for showmanship and character with an absence of any stage fright, Wittenburg said. They wanted turkeys that would strut and gobble for the cameras and the president yet remain calm on the table, he said. 
The birds got officially named Drumstick and Wishbone on Monday, and the White House opened a Twitter poll on which one Trump should pardon. They stayed at a hotel near the White House for the run-up to the big show. A flock-mate was pardoned by Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton on Friday. 
The presidential birds will finish out their lives in leisure at Virginia Tech, joining the 2016 winners, Tater and Tot, at Gobbler’s Rest in Blacksburg. With luck, they might live another year or more. A few of their predecessors have hit the ripe old age of 2. Very few domestic turkeys live that long. The vast majority get sent to processing plants when they’re between 14 to 20 weeks old. 
THE RISKS 
Pardons have not always gone smoothly and gratitude is not guaranteed. 
In 2001, a turkey named Liberty pecked President George W. Bush in the midsection — some reports say his crotch — drawing laughs from the crowd and an awkward expression from the president’s face. 
Another memorable photo shows a grimacing President Ronald Reagan getting a face full of feathers when the 1984 turkey started flapping its wings. A turkey also flapped around on Reagan before jumping off the table and strutting around the White House lawn in 1981. 
TURKEY FACTS 
Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, with 450 farmers raising about 46 million turkeys this year. North Carolina is No. 2. They’re among six states that account for nearly two-thirds of U.S. turkey production. The others are Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri and Virginia. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that farmers will raise nearly 245 million turkeys this year. The National Turkey Federation estimates that Americans will eat about 46 million for Thanksgiving, 22 million at Christmas and 19 million for Easter. But most turkeys are destined to become deli meat, sausage and other products.

Her latest book, ""The Evangelicals,"" explores one of America's most prominent faith groups. Kelsey Dallas, Deseret News 
Frances FitzGerald has a knack for timing. 
Curiosity brought her to Jerry Falwell's church in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1979, on the cusp of a political revolution. The evangelical leader was about to launch the Moral Majority, which helped conservative Christians become a major political force. 
""Being a New Yorker, I'd never seen a fundamentalist before, as far as I knew. I was totally fascinated,"" she said. 
She kept tabs on Falwell and his successors over the years, watching as evangelical Christians became a key voting bloc within the Republican Party. Nearly four decades after her church visit in Virginia, she published a 752-page overview of the faith, just in time to dissect evangelical support for President Donald Trump. 
""I became convinced that the only way for people to understand evangelicals is to understand their history,"" FitzGerald said. 
""The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America"" was a finalist for this year's National Book Award in nonfiction, awarded Nov. 15 to Masha Gessen for ""The Future is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia."" FitzGerald previously won a National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for ""Fire in the Lake,"" which explores Vietnamese history and American involvement in the Vietnam War. 
We turned to FitzGerald this week for help understanding some of the biggest religion news stories of the year. This interview was edited for length and clarity. 
Evangelicals are in the news this week for standing by Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore after he was accused of sexual misconduct. Where does that instinct to protect Moore come from? 
It comes from the same place that the instinct to support Donald Trump came from. 
Moore is well-known in his state, and he's upheld what many people think of as Christian values. He's practically gone to jail for them. 
In the past, he put up the Ten Commandments on the wall of his courthouse. He's been known to make all kinds of radical remarks about homosexuality and guns and so forth. 
I think people believe that Roy Moore and they themselves as evangelicals are being persecuted by Yankees and The Washington Post and so on. That they're not being allowed to live as they want to. 
What prompted that sense of persecution? 
I think it goes back to the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy (in the 1920s and 1930s.) Fundamentalists tried to take over the Baptist and Presbyterian churches and failed. They became separatists and began to feel that everyone was against them. The real problem was that nobody paid any attention to them. 
Then, the 1960s and 1970s brought radical changes like feminism. There were a lot of people who felt these shifts were interfering with their way of life, traditional families and so forth. 
But evangelicals have also persecuted other faith groups, and there have been high-profile attacks, for example, on Mormons and Muslims. Does this aggression stem from theological or political concerns? 
I think their political persona derives from theological differences. 
Obviously, the worst thing you can be as far as many evangelicals are concerned is Muslim. But theologically, that's not necessarily true. You could imagine a preacher making the case that Mormons are worse than Muslims theologically. 
But since Muslims are associated with the Middle East and terrorism and understood to be anti-Israel, they become more politically incorrect, if you will. 
As evangelicals face the same membership decline affecting most faith groups today, are they becoming more open to interfaith alliances? 
Absolutely. But I think it only goes so far. 
They can align with the Catholic Church on abortion and contraception, but they run into problems with other social justice issues. It really depends on if you're talking about conservative Catholics or progressive Catholics. 
Why should people who aren't evangelical Christians care about this faith group? 
They represent one-fifth to a quarter of the entire country. They are a large part of the Republican Party, and, to some extent, they run the party. Politically, they're very important. 
When they went for Trump, it made a big difference for the Trump campaign. 
Evangelical support for Trump came as a surprise to many Americans, including leaders within the evangelical Christian community. What happened? 
Nobody expected the vote to go for Trump, including leaders of the Christian right. During the early part of the primaries, 50 of them got together and decided who to vote for and, of course, they chose Ted Cruz, who they thought was the most plausible. After all, he's an evangelical and a Texas conservative. 
But then it turned out that only a minority of evangelicals voted for Cruz, which is fairly unprecedented. The evangelical world is splintering in many ways. 
Many right-wing evangelicals were part of the tea party, for example. And there's also a progressive left wing that didn't exist before 2005. 
And younger evangelicals tend to be more like the progressives. They're social-justice oriented. They haven't given up on (changing) abortion laws, but they tend to support homosexual rights and gay marriage. 
What will the splintering mean for the next election? 
It really depends on who runs. 
The changes are going to be incremental, because they're demographic. Young evangelicals don't vote as much as older people, but, as they grow older, they will. 
The splintering is going to continue. Right-wing evangelicals will join with the secular right, while progressive evangelicals join with people of other faiths and secular people over the issues they care about, like immigration. 
It may be that we won't be talking about an evangelical vote.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to receive a phone call from Russia President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after Putin wrapped up a meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad on Monday.The news of the phone call was revealed by Russian media outlets and not the White House, an anomaly that frustrated quite a few reporters. Information regarding the nature of the phone call was limited as the Russian media only conveyed that Putin is expected to discuss his meeting with Assad and post-conflict resolutions in Syria with Trump.

While Republicans have struggled to pass major legislation this year, the margins with which their tax cut bill passed the House should convince people that some form of this legislation will become law. The Senate is still wrestling with details, but a signature corporate tax cut ""paid for"" by eliminating deductions of state and local taxes and other goodies favored by the upper-middle class seems to be where we're headed.

But a look ahead at economic, demographic and political trends hints that ultimately, when tax reform comes up again in the next decade, the wealthy could lose all of their gains from this bill and then some. 
The place to start is by looking at the current state of the federal budget deficit. At around 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, it's in the range of normal that it's been for the past few decades. But at the current low level of unemployment, the government ought to have no deficit at all. The last time the unemployment rate was as low as it is now, in 1999 and 2000, we had a federal budget surplus. As Good as It Gets? Federal budget surplus as a percentage of GDP Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 
Deficits tend to shrink when the economy grows, as tax receipts rise faster than outlays. And vice versa in recessions. With the labor market around full employment, it's likely that this is about as good as it’s going to get for the deficit in this cycle. 
There are unavoidable and avoidable reasons that deficits have widened since the turn of the century. 
In the unavoidable category is the aging of the population. In the late 1990s, the baby boomer generation was in its high-earning mid-life years, and there were relatively few retirees. Now that large generation is entering retirement, and the ratio of retirees to workers is rising. This puts a greater burden on government finances, especially as health-care costs continue to grow. 
In the avoidable category are policy decisions made during the 2000s. The Bush tax cuts and debt burdens from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are large contributors to today's structural deficit. The legacy of the economic downturn and its impact on growth in the ensuing years is another contributor. 
The path over the next decade leads to much wider structural budget deficits than America has ever seen before. The $1.5 trillion deficit expansion put forward by this tax bill could add a half percentage point of GDP to the deficit. The continued aging of the population and growth in entitlement spending could add another couple of points . At some point the two parties may decide to get serious about an infrastructure bill, and that could be another $1 trillion in spending. A recession might increase the deficit by another 3 or 4 percentage of points of GDP for a time. And there's always the possibility of increased military engagement and spending. We could be looking at structural deficits of 6 or 7 percentage points of GDP with temporary deficits in the double digits. 
And that doesn't address the politics. Once Americans were fed up with President George W. Bush, they put Democrats and President Barack Obama in charge. After Obama's administration, they've put President Donald Trump and the Republicans in charge. Given current polling and the results we've seen so far in special elections and the elections in Virginia and New Jersey, we should expect that over the next several years Democrats will be swept back to power. 
The nature of that Democratic coalition is likely to be different from past Democratic waves. In 2016, Republicans did worst relative to 2012 in wealthy, well-educated suburbs that were generally more favorable to Mitt Romney. The strong showing of Democrats in the 2017 Virginia elections were in these same places in northern Virginia. The structure of this tax bill is worst for wealthy, Republican-held districts in blue states like New York, New Jersey and California. These are the types of upper-middle class Republicans who typically have supported fiscal conservatism and lower taxes, since they personally benefited from such policies. This new version of the Republican Party has less to offer them fiscally. 
When tax reform comes up again in the next decade, which it most likely will because some of the proposed tax cuts for individuals are set to phase out after 10 years , it'll likely be with a Democratic majority in charge. This majority will be led by women, people of color, and wealthy, well-educated suburban voters. And given demographic trends on the Republican side, that Republican minority will probably be centered increasingly in rural, poorer districts. Without old-guard Republicans like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell around to protect their interests, the ultra-wealthy may find themselves isolated at a time when Congress is looking to plug a big hole in the deficit. 
It may be cold comfort for those who find themselves with higher tax burdens over the next several years, but for those concerned about the long-term direction of policy, it appears that the wealthy will get their turn to pay -- in the not-so-distant future.

51,Marwa Eltagouri - The Washington Post,2017-11-21T19:58:06.000+02:00,"{'persons': [], 'organizations': [], 'locations': []}",[],,,english,0,2017-11-21T17:45:00.000+02:00,,"A Florida church has a warning for visitors: 'This is not a gun free zone'   10:45 AM Marwa Eltagouri - The Washington Post 
Two days after a gunman killed 26 people at a small Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a pastor at a Tampa Bay church took to Instagram. 
Senior Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church posted a photo of the signs on his church doors: ""WE ARE HEAVILY ARMED - ANY ATTEMPT WILL BE DEALT WITH DEADLY FORCE - YES WE ARE A CHURCH AND WE WILL PROTECT OUR PEOPLE."" 
The signs on the 21-year-old nondenominational church are about a year old, but caught national attention on social media after Howard-Browne's post was picked up by media outlets in the weeks after the Sutherland Springs shooting. The post has received both praise and criticism. 
""Very sad that it is necessary to carry and be alert for killers while worshiping. It is our right and our duty to protect self and others - even in church,"" Instagram user dorothea6111 commented. 
""Awesome! Had the same idea for my church,"" another Instagram user, gerswhin75, commented. ""For those that are shocked by this - God will protect His people, but He expects us to do our part. That's why we use seat belts, or wear helmets . . . just like others. We do our part, let God do His."" 
Some state and federal officials have called for greater security measures in places of worship in the weeks after the shooting in Sutherland Springs, where an armed civilian returned fire on the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley. There have been more than a dozen fatal shootings since 2012 at U.S. houses of worship, according to the Associated Press. Faith leaders say churches are particularly vulnerable. 
Many of the 1,200 to 1,300 members of the River at Tampa Bay Church are armed and prepared to use their weapons if necessary, Associate Pastor Allen Hawes told the Tampa Bay Times. Hawes, who has been with the church for 15 years, has a concealed weapons license himself, he told the newspaper. The church also holds concealed weapons permit classes, he said. 
""It is a deterrent,"" he told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Look at what is going on. In the past two months, look at what happened in Texas. Look at what happened in Las Vegas. Because we are a church that is on television, we are very involved in the community. We want people to know that this is a safe zone."" 
Hawes said the church follows local crime closely, including the unsolved homicides of four people in a Tampa neighborhood. 
""I think just collectively, we pay very close attention,"" Hawes told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Look at Seminole Heights. Someone is murdering people. This stuff is happening all the time. Do you wait for another shooting to take precautions?"" 
Other pastors, like Southern Baptist pastor Jack Graham, say it is important for all churches - large and small - to have a security procedure in the event of a shooting. 
""We are living in dangerous days,"" Graham, an evangelical adviser to President Donald Trump, said on Twitter. His Plano, Texas, megachurch, he said earlier this month, is preparing to host church leaders for a security training. 
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, R, told Fox News shortly after the shooting that authorities cannot keep guns away from those intent on breaking the law. Concealed weapons laws, however, can let armed citizens stop a gunman before first responders arrive on a scene. 
""We've had shootings at churches for forever,"" the attorney general, who has advocated concealed-carry laws in the past, told Fox News. ""It's going to happen again, so we need people in churches - either professional security or at least arming some of the parishioners, or the congregation, so they can respond when something like this happens again."" 
But Manny Garcia, the deputy   Texas Democratic Party, criticized Paxton's comments. 
""Something is woefully wrong when elected officials wring their hands and suggest we can only stay safe by bringing arsenals to church,"" he told the Dallas Morning News. ""Texans deserve more from their chief law enforcement official than inaction and willful ignorance. The answer to horrific gun violence is not more of the same. Lord knows we have already had plenty of that."" 
At the River at Tampa Bay Church, parishioner Julian Sutton told ABC Action News that he supports Howard-Browne and other leaders' security measures. 
""People are in a place that they should feel safe,"" Sutton said. ""To know that we have people that carry, in the event that something were to take place, that something like that could be stopped."" 
Howard-Browne, who came to Florida from South Africa nearly 30 years ago as a missionary, was among a group of evangelical leaders who met with Trump in the Oval Office in July and laid their hands on him as he bowed in prayer. Trump gave the leaders a tour of his private quarters in the White House before he announced an executive order on religious freedom. 
Howard-Browne posted photos of the meeting on Instagram and wrote in a Facebook post that he was asked to pray over Trump. The pastor asked God for ""supernatural wisdom, guidance and protection,"" he wrote. 
""Wow - we are going to see another great spiritual awakening,"" he wrote. 
Howard-Browne could not immediately be reached for comment.

Thirty years ago, on Dec. 8, 1987, the leaders of the USSR and the US – Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan – signed a treaty to eliminate intermediate- and shorter-range missiles (the INF Treaty). 
While it was being actively implemented , 1,846 Soviet and 846 American nuclear-armed, land-based, ballistic and cruise missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers were destroyed. 
After completely eliminating these missiles by the summer of 1991, both sides were satisfied that they had been able to fulfill all the provisions of this important bilateral agreement. 
But beginning in June 2012, the administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump have become increasingly more insistent that Russia is violating this treaty. 
Is this criticism justified? 
Or is the very United States violating this treaty? 
And if so, in what ways ? *** 
In December 1979, NATO adopted what was known as its Double-Track Decision. That alliance began preparations for a Western-European deployment of Pershing II ballistic missiles and Tomahawk ground-launched cruise missiles that were in their final stages of development, while simultaneously offering to begin negotiating with the Soviet Union on intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear forces. On Nov. 18, 1981, the United States declared its readiness to cancel the deployment of its Pershing II and Tomahawk missiles, if the Soviet Union would dismantle all its intermediate-range missiles in both the European and Asian parts of that country. But this would effectively mean a unilateral disarmament for the Soviets, since for every two Soviet SS-20 (RSD-10) missiles being deployed, the USSR would be retiring three SS-4 (R-12) and SS-5 (R-14) missiles. Several Pershing II missiles prepared for launching at Fort Bliss McGregor Range, 1987. 
And so Moscow turned down this proposal, but it initiated negotiations to dramatically reduce or to even completely discontinue all types of intermediate-range nuclear weapons (including the aircraft that carry them) and to suspend any updates on them while the negotiations were underway. 
However, the United States declined that offer and in late 1983 began deploying new nuclear missiles in Europe, where the countries of the alliance already had 857 nuclear carriers in place, including 651 aircraft belonging to the US (the F-111, F-111A, and F-4, plus its carrier-based aircraft stationed along the borders of the European continent), as well as 64 ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads from the United Kingdom and 98 nuclear missiles and 44 bombers belonging to France, all of which could together carry more than 400 nuclear warheads. 
At that time the Soviet Union only owned 938 examples of such weaponry. If the NATO nations stationed another 572 nuclear missiles on the European continent, at that point the arsenals of the alliance’s nuclear powers would be 50% larger than those of the Warsaw Treaty countries. Thus, the approximate parity in the two sides’ nuclear missiles would be substantially tilted in favor of the trans-Atlantic military alliance. 
Consequently the Soviet Union called a halt to the negotiations that had already begun. 
A new stage began when Mikhail Gorbachev reopened those talks upon being elected to lead the USSR. He was a proponent of measures to encourage global nuclear disarmament and in 1986 put forth a step-by-step plan to create a nuclear-free world. 
The first round of negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons and intermediate-range nuclear missiles began in Geneva on March 12, 1985, but no specific agreements were reached. 
The next round of negotiations was held in Reykjavik (Iceland) in September of 1986. There the USSR announced that it was prepared to sign a separate agreement on intermediate-range missiles, under which Soviet and American missiles of this class would be removed from Europe within five years, with only 100 warheads mounted on such missiles to be retained in the Asian part of the USSR and in the US. At the same time, it was proposed that the USSR and the US agree to keep equal numbers of short-range tactical missiles, provided that neither side would deploy such missiles in Europe. Moscow also agreed “not to count” the nuclear weapons belonging to Great Britain and France. A decision on intermediate-range air carriers was postponed. 
And so on Dec. 8, 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed the open-ended Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. The two leaders exchanged not only the paper copies of the treaty itself, but also the pens with which they signed it. At the same time, two protocols were also signed (the Protocol on Procedures Governing the Elimination of the Missile Systems and the Inspection Protocol), in addition to the Memorandum of Understanding Regarding the Establishment of the Data Base for the Treaty. 
During the negotiations that preceded the agreement, the Soviets were operating on the assumption that the Pershing II ballistic missiles were equipped with variable-yield, earth-penetrating warheads and high-precision guidance systems. This was a new innovation not previously seen on ballistic missiles of this type. The Tomahawk cruise missiles boasted improved guidance accuracy and were a difficult target for anti-aircraft defenses. 
All this, along with the short flight times (8-10 minutes) of the American nuclear missiles deployed in Europe, posed a threat to Soviet central command posts, fixed intercontinental ballistic-missile launch sites, and other elements of the Soviet nuclear infrastructure inside the European part of the USSR. Moreover, Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles were not capable of reaching the US from their launch sites on the European continent, while their American counterparts could potentially land deep inside Soviet territory. 
As recalled by the Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Arms Control, Paul Nitze, Republican President Ronald Reagan was primarily motivated to sign the INF Treaty based on his fear of the serious threat posed to American and NATO installations in Europe and Asia by the Soviet SS-20 (RSD-10) missile, which had extended range capability and could accommodate up to three warheads each. [Department of State Bulletin. 1988. February. Vol. 88. Number 2131. p. 81.] Soviet RSD-10 (Pioneer-3) missile complex, photo taken in mid-1980s. 
The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles took effect on June 1, 1988, after being ratified by both parties and upon the exchange of instruments of ratification. 
The Gorbachev-Reagan Treaty did not apply to sea-based or air-launched missiles, nor did it stipulate the destruction of the missiles’ nuclear warheads. 
In addition to the physical destruction of the missiles of the two classes mentioned above, the two sides pledged to eliminate, no later than three years after the treaty took effect, the launchers and launch canisters, launch facilities and auxiliary equipment, missile vehicles and simulators, launch pads, and other equipment stationed at 43 sites in Russia, 66 sites in other Soviet republics (Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine) and in two of its Warsaw Treaty allies: at six sites in East Germany and one in Czechoslovakia, as well as at 32 sites in the US and in five Western European countries (Washington’s NATO allies of Belgium, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and West Germany). 
It should be noted that in 1984, three countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Great Britain, the US, and France) combined owned 50% more nuclear warheads on intermediate-range missiles and aircraft as did the USSR. 
As a result of the INF Treaty , by May 28, 1991, 2,692 intermediate- and shorter-range missiles were destroyed : the Soviet Union destroyed 1,846, and the US – 846. 
At that time, this arsenal represented only 4% of the world’s stockpiles of nuclear weapons. 
Article VI of the treaty banned both the future production and flight-testing of any intermediate-range or shorter-range missiles, as well as the production of any stages or launchers of such missiles. 
The INF Treaty made provision for a meticulous regime of verification. Each side had the right to conduct on-site inspections, both within the territory of the other country, as well as within the territories of the countries where the missiles targeted for destruction were currently deployed, and they were also permitted to use national technical means of verification. In order to conduct inspections within the territories of America’s NATO allies, on Dec. 11, 1987, Washington signed corresponding agreements with Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and West Germany. 
Over the course of 13 years of work, the two sides’ inspection teams conducted approximately 1,200 inspections of various types both inside each other’s countries, as well as in other states. On May 21, 2001, an agreement was signed in Moscow marking the completion of the regime of inspections under the INF Treaty. By mutual agreement, all inspections officially ended at midnight on May 31, 2001. 
The INF Treaty was the first international treaty to formalize the complete and irreversible destruction of two classes of nuclear-armed missiles. 
In October 2007, Russia proposed an initiative to add a global dimension to the provisions of the INF Treaty – suggesting, in other words, that that bilateral agreement be transformed into a multilateral treaty. It is a fact that such types of weaponized missiles are owned by a large number of states – as many as 32, according to American researchers. [Brad Hicks, George Galdorisi, and Scott Truver. The Aegis BMD Global Enterprise// Naval War College Review. 2012. Summer. pp.67-68]. 
At the UN Conference on Disarmament in February 2008, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov introduced a document , titled “ The Basic Elements of an International Legal Agreement to Eliminate Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range (Ground-Based) Missiles, Opened For Broad International Accession ” which could serve as a prototype for a future multilateral agreement. But the United States, which had initially backed this idea, quickly dropped its support. It was also rejected by Washington’s nuclear allies: Great Britain and France. 
Although the 1987 treaty is termless, the parties have the right to withdraw from it, six months after giving such notice, if they decide that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the treaty have “jeopardized their supreme interests.” 
But if the INF Treaty is beneficial for both sides, wouldn’t it be quite natural for both Russia and the US to scrupulously comply with all of its provisions?

He’s a great, Zoolander -level squinter. Perhaps one of the world’s all-time great squinters. He’s apparently amazing at purchasing and eating KFC. It’s not a game with Trump’s Chicken Littles combo-eating game. When Donald Trump walks into a room, potato wedges piss their pants and get hives. And I’m certain he’s awesome at Jenga. Because if he can stack and erect piles of bullshit as high as he does, Jenga towers are light work.
His greatest talent, however, is dog-whistling. From “Make America great again” to his petty preoccupation with reversing literally everything President Barack Obama did, no one in recent memory has been better at tailoring their actions and communications to convey a very specific point to a very specific group of people.

To wit, take a look at his recent tweets admonishing Marshawn Lynch and LaVar Ball.
The existence of these tweets is a dog whistle in itself. A white person in power publicly admonishing uppity blacks is chum to Trump’s base ( and by “Trump’s base” I mean “America” ), and these tweeting sprees are feeding sessions.

The language here matters, too—specifically the idea of disrespect and the lack of proper reverence for Trump’s big white benevolence. What he is saying is that these black people need to be grateful for what they have—and what he’s specifically given them—but since they’re very obviously not, they need to be reminded, publicly and vehemently, of their place and position. Basically, let’s not forget—and let’s not allow them to forget—that they’re niggers.
The “ disrespectful black ” employed as a stand-in for “nigger” isn’t new. It stretches back as far as the invention of the nigger does. The nigger was created to hierarchize and to justify subjugation. And when one of us dared step out of line or question this status, we were ungrateful niggers without the moral or intellectual acuity to recognize how appreciative we should be. Now, since “nigger” is no longer allowed in polite society, a reference to that damning lack of perpetual genuflection articulates that same point.
“They already get so many things for free,” they’re wont to say, “so why are they protesting and not on their knees in thanks?”
This, of course, is just one of the many terms shoehorned into the American lexicon now to describe and communicate and distinguish the nigger without actually saying that word. Because of course saying that would be racist. And racism is wrong.
We all know about “ thug, ” which has been such an obvious dog whistle for so long that the word itself is (rightly) seen as a slur . It officially transcended the dog whistle. Which I guess would make it a ... ghost whistle?
Then there’s any out-of-context reference to Chicago, which is such an absurd “nigger” stand-in when you remember that it’s a fucking city . A city where whites are still the largest racial demographic. Chicago as a nigger stand-in is like, I don’t know, if white people started calling us “Kia Cadenzas.”

But as odd as Chicago is, I’m not quite sure if it beats the surreality of allusions to the government. The federal government particularly. I forgot exactly where I first read or heard it, but along with the fact that many whites believe that we (niggers) are disproportionally supported by the government—an assistance we don’t deserve—a not-insignificant-at-all part of the white distaste for the federal government is that so many of us (niggers) have government jobs.
So when they’re pushing to limit the size and scope of Washington, D.C., and bureaucracies, they’re ultimately pushing for niggers to have less (perceived) cushion and less income. Do they not realize that niggers/niggas hate the Man, too?
Of course, there are more nigger stand-ins. Socialist. Muslim. In sports, undisciplined is a nigger stand-in fav. And there will continue to be more, as they’ll continue to be forced to be more and more creative when some of these terms transcend the dog whistle.

Basically, if you’re black, don’t be surprised if, the next time you happen to offend a white person, she has that “I really want to say ‘nigger’” look on her face, but she calls you a Kia Cadenza instead.","{'uuid': '53f564215fbf5efa584985e45177386381078e07', 'url':

Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said a joint US Africa Command military team on November 12 discovered the remains at the site where Sergeant La David Johnson's body was recovered following the October 4 attack.
""Today, we can confirm that the Armed Forces Medical Examiner has positively identified these remains as those of Sergeant Johnson,"" White said in a statement, without giving any additional details.
A US defense official later told AFP that the remains were ""small bone fragments.""
Johnson was one of four US soldiers and five Nigerien troops killed in the ambush of a joint US-Niger patrol in the village of Tongo Tongo near the Niger-Mali border.
He was buried October 21, 2017 in Hollywood, Florida.
Johnson's patrol was attacked by about 50 local fighters associated with the Islamic State group.
Questions have been raised over why it took hours before backup support reached the patrol, and why Johnson's body was left behind and only recovered the following day.
His death was politicized when a US congresswoman accused Donald Trump of being insensitive during a phone call with Johnson's widow, an account she and her mother also supported while the president denied it.","{'uuid': '6d100ab0dfbf9a740b8260f9904ed2ea3e690be8', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJLSBqHpCF4hkrrF0cfr764TwhEw5T08uswnFBr5NHOncI_UZFekoIRvybnNfnhLNhH2SGL5fRpYdjoIIiuLcU0Q--', 'site_full': 'www.yahoo.com', 'site': 'yahoo.com', 'site_section': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/', 'site_categories': ['search_engine', 'media', 'tech'], 'section_title': 'World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines', 'title': 'More remains of slain US soldier found in Niger', 'title_full': 'More remains of slain US soldier found in Niger', 'published': '2017-11-22T01:29:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 0, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.132, 'main_image': 'https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gokmbkcIzgXowsiS_QyLmA--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/6b7bfcc821dedc999540801b41defee3f5b1564e.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 5, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 38, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 38}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 2}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",More remains of slain US soldier found in Niger,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJLSBqHpCF4hkrrF0cfr764TwhEw5T08uswnFBr5NHOncI_UZFekoIRvybnNfnhLNhH2SGL5fRpYdjoIIiuLcU0Q--,6d100ab0dfbf9a740b8260f9904ed2ea3e690be8

""It seems undeniable at this point that Hugh Hefner's death broke open some sort of seal."" My former colleague at National Review magazine, Ian Tuttle, tweeted this the other day, referring to the avalanche of accusations and confessions of men behaving badly in some of the highest echelons of power that has occurred since the death of the Playboy founder. A reckoning appears to be occurring in Hollywood, accompanied by a widespread acknowledgment that something has gone very wrong when it comes to men in power and sex. 
Why is it that men would ever presume to take what is not theirs? Why is it that women have been too afraid to speak up? Could it be that the expectations of the culture have forced both men and women into untenable positions? Could it be that we've been breathing an air that has us believing the other gender exists for gratification rather than awe and reverence? 
There was something in that Donald Trump infamous hot-mic incident -- where he described this profane mindset of men in power -- that was clarifying and almost set the stage for all these recent stories. The now-first lady dismissed it all as ""what boys do."" One gets the impression that she's trying to raise her son otherwise. So why would Melania Trump or anyone else tolerate it or otherwise explain it away? 
When the U.S. Catholic bishops gathered in Baltimore for their annual meeting this past week, there was a presentation noting, among other things, the upcoming 50th anniversary of ""Humanae Vitae,"" a document that in 1968 seemed to do what my own magazine's founder was inspired to do vis-a-vis the Cold War, among other things: ""Stand athwart history, yelling 'Stop,'"" as it says in the 1955 National Review mission statement. Paul VI, the author of ""Humanae,"" saw a radical revolution afoot that was going to make the world worse, for women in particular. 
Speaking before his brother bishops, New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan highlighted prophetic passages from Paul VI's letter, including: ""(A) man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection."" 
And so it happened. And so we live among the ruins. 
While there are men who have come out to accuse prominent actors of assault and other boorish behavior, the majority of the #MeToo movement testifying to abuse of power has been women, talking about men. Some 30 or so years ago, Pope John Paul II wrote about the role of women in changing the world. He focused on two things in particular, as Mary Rice Hasson, founding director of the Catholic Women's Forum at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, put it in a talk: 
""The first is to bring 'full dignity' to the 'conjugal life and to motherhood.' The second and related task is that women are called to 'assure the moral dimension of culture ... a culture worthy of the person.'"" 
Hasson issued a challenge to her sisters in the faith: 
""Women must be front and center in evangelizing the culture because, as a Church, we must live that truth of complementarity. We believe that there's something of value created when men and women work together, and we know that the Church needs us -- men and women -- to witness to the love of God in a powerful way, together. And the world needs that witness from us as much, if not more, than it needs the actual work that we do."" 
I'll add this: Everyone is welcome to join in leading a way out of the misery of seeing others merely as means to instant pleasure or another selfish gain. 
Besides ""Humanae Vitae,"" Paul VI also issued this message that has resurfaced in recent years: 
""Women, you do know how to make truth sweet, tender and accessible, make it your task to bring the spirit of this council into institutions, schools, homes and daily life. Women of the entire universe, whether Christian or non-believing, you to whom life is entrusted at this grave moment in history, it is for you to save the peace of the world."" 
With this light shining on the darkest places in Hollywood and elsewhere, there's a tremendous opportunity to turn the ship around. Women can save the peace of the world, by expecting better for themselves, their sisters, their daughters -- and the men who ought to love them (thank you, those who do!) for all the beauty they bring to existence.

Morning Brief: CBS programming goes dark for Dish customers as two companies argue over carriage fees, viewers horrified over prospects that they may be forced to talk to family members over the Thanksgiving holiday (thank God for smartphones) 
W as the issue of giant monopolies a major issue in the last election? Not that I can remember, though it probably should have been. 
That’s what makes the idea that the Justice Department suing AT&T to prevent the Time Warner deal a bit strange. 
What we know is that the president hates CNN, but loves big American corporations. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, made a fortune talking to big companies for fees. So, that means that the power being accumulated by giant companies like Comcast, AT&T, Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook never really was an issue discussed much in the 2016 presidential election. What we got was a debate over was a puppet (though it really wasn’t a debate so much as a childish spat). 
It is ironic that AT&T is about to wage battle against an unpopular administration, because as early as today that same administration is going to hand AT&T and others even more control over our lives when the FCC outlines its plans to overturn net neutrality rules. This will grow the power of companies like AT&T to determine what content you can receive and at what speeds, virtually dictating our use of the Internet. 
Bloomberg , Sara Forden, David McLaughlin and Scott Moritz : AT&T, U.S. Prepare to Battle in Court Over Time Warner Merger 
A defiant Randall Stephenson told antitrust enforcers that AT&T Inc. would see them in court after the Justice Department sued to block the company’s $85.4 billion bid to buy Time Warner Inc. 
The lawsuit “stretches the very idea of antitrust law beyond the breaking point,” Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive officer, said at a briefing Monday. He left the door open for negotiations to find a way for the deal to pass federal muster — but reiterated that he wouldn’t sell CNN to appease Washington, whether the deal was influenced by President Donald Trump or not. 
Reuters , Supantha Mukherjee : Law likely on AT&T’s side in Time Warner battle: analysts 
AT&T Inc is likely to emerge victorious from a legal fight with the United States Department of Justice over its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc, analysts said in a series of research notes on Tuesday… 
We are surprised at the lawsuit as there are decades of clear legal precedent on how these deals are handled,” Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a client note. 
“We see a 75 percent chance AT&T wins at trial and the onus is on the DOJ to prove potential harm.” 
Politico , Jack Shafer : AT&T Should Thank the Trump Administration 
Although AT&T has vowed to fight the government’s soon-to-be-announced lawsuit, the company should take advantage of the government’s intervention to retreat. Acquisitions like this rarely make money for the buyer, and such media acquisitions often dissolve into a crucible of tears as the buyer comes to his senses and unloads the properties he once so coveted. 
The Verge , Jacob Kastrenakes : FCC is expected to unveil its plan to destroy net neutrality during Thanksgiving week 
While Americans are busy traveling, paying attention to Black Friday deals, and spending time with family, the Federal Communications Commission will be rolling out its least popular proposal of the year: its final plan to dismantle net neutrality — the set of rules that prevent internet providers from giving some websites and internet traffic an advantage over others… 
…Republicans at the FCC, who are behind this proposal, argue that the stricter rules enacted two years ago have hampered investment in broadband and caused internet providers to slow the expansion of their networks. This is a problem, given that the FCC is tasked with ensuring the entire country gets connected. But there isn’t a ton of data to back this up. It’s only been two years, and though there was a small dip in investment, it was also attributable to factors like high oil prices and costly acquisitions. The Republican commissioners also just generally believe that making companies fill out compliance forms and follow rules is onerous and prevents innovation. 
Dish customers no longer can view CBS programming this morning as the two companies continue their dispute over carriage fees. 
What CBS wants, of course, is more money from Dish for the right to carry its programming. Wants to for CBS not to add to the pressure on them to raise prices to customers at a time when many are deciding to cut the cord permanently. 
The move may mean that families will be forced to talk to each other in Dish households this Thanksgiving. This could be a problem in those households where the conversation turns to politics, though. 
Variety , Brian Steinberg : CBS is Blacked Out on Dish as Carriage Talks Hit Snag 
In total, the disagreement means 28 local channels in 18 markets across 26 states will be off the air until the two sides can agree upon terms for a new contract. 
The showdown pits a TV company keen to use its top-rated broadcast programming to eke out new deals with distributors of all sorts with a satellite company that has demonstrated a flair for hard-nosed negotiations in recent years. “CBS is attempting to tax Dish customers on programming that’s losing viewers, tax Dish customers on programming available for free over the air, and tax Dish customers for content available directly from CBS,” said Warren Schlichting, Dish executive vice president of marketing, programming and media sales, in a statement. “Our customers are clear: they don’t want to pay a CBS tax. It’s regrettable and unnecessary that CBS is bringing its greed into the homes of millions of families this Thanksgiving.” 
Broadcasting & Cable , John Eggerton : ATVA: CBS ‘Cash-Grab’ Threatens Frosty the Snowman 
The American Television Alliance whose members include hundreds of cable systems and major satellite operators, has renewed its call for the government to reform “outdated and broken video laws.” 
In the wake of CBS stations coming off DISH TV two days before the Thanksgiving holiday, ATVA put the blame squarely on CBS and said it should restore the signals ASAP. ATVA said the company was willing to block the Thanksgiving Day Parade, Frosty the Snowman and NFL football, all Thanksgiving traditions, in “an obvious cash grab.” 
Twitter… Maybe it is time the company is forced to register as an agent of a foreign government. 
The Daily Beast , Betsy Woodruff, Ben Collins and Spencer Ackerman : Twitter Has Turned Over Zero New Russian Troll Accounts to Congress 
Twitter has not provided the House and Senate Russia investigations with any additional Kremlin-backed imposter accounts and bots since at least Nov. 1, The Daily Beast has confirmed. The lack of new disclosure comes as evidence continues to mount that inauthentic Russian activity continues apace on the microblogging platform… 
…While not disputing The Daily Beast’s story, a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement that the company is “continuing to work closely with congressional investigators to provide information relevant to their inquiries, consistent with our policies and federal privacy rules.

Her latest book, ""The Evangelicals,"" explores one of America's most prominent faith groups. Kelsey Dallas, Deseret News 
Frances FitzGerald has a knack for timing. 
Curiosity brought her to Jerry Falwell's church in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1979, on the cusp of a political revolution. The evangelical leader was about to launch the Moral Majority, which helped conservative Christians become a major political force. 
""Being a New Yorker, I'd never seen a fundamentalist before, as far as I knew. I was totally fascinated,"" she said. 
She kept tabs on Falwell and his successors over the years, watching as evangelical Christians became a key voting bloc within the Republican Party. Nearly four decades after her church visit in Virginia, she published a 752-page overview of the faith, just in time to dissect evangelical support for President Donald Trump. 
""I became convinced that the only way for people to understand evangelicals is to understand their history,"" FitzGerald said. 
""The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America"" was a finalist for this year's National Book Award in nonfiction, awarded Nov. 15 to Masha Gessen for ""The Future is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia."" FitzGerald previously won a National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for ""Fire in the Lake,"" which explores Vietnamese history and American involvement in the Vietnam War. 
We turned to FitzGerald this week for help understanding some of the biggest religion news stories of the year. This interview was edited for length and clarity. 
Evangelicals are in the news this week for standing by Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore after he was accused of sexual misconduct. Where does that instinct to protect Moore come from? 
It comes from the same place that the instinct to support Donald Trump came from. 
Moore is well-known in his state, and he's upheld what many people think of as Christian values. He's practically gone to jail for them. 
In the past, he put up the Ten Commandments on the wall of his courthouse. He's been known to make all kinds of radical remarks about homosexuality and guns and so forth. 
I think people believe that Roy Moore and they themselves as evangelicals are being persecuted by Yankees and The Washington Post and so on. That they're not being allowed to live as they want to. 
What prompted that sense of persecution? 
I think it goes back to the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy (in the 1920s and 1930s.) Fundamentalists tried to take over the Baptist and Presbyterian churches and failed. They became separatists and began to feel that everyone was against them. The real problem was that nobody paid any attention to them. 
Then, the 1960s and 1970s brought radical changes like feminism. There were a lot of people who felt these shifts were interfering with their way of life, traditional families and so forth. 
But evangelicals have also persecuted other faith groups, and there have been high-profile attacks, for example, on Mormons and Muslims. Does this aggression stem from theological or political concerns? 
I think their political persona derives from theological differences. 
Obviously, the worst thing you can be as far as many evangelicals are concerned is Muslim. But theologically, that's not necessarily true. You could imagine a preacher making the case that Mormons are worse than Muslims theologically. 
But since Muslims are associated with the Middle East and terrorism and understood to be anti-Israel, they become more politically incorrect, if you will. 
As evangelicals face the same membership decline affecting most faith groups today, are they becoming more open to interfaith alliances? 
Absolutely. But I think it only goes so far. 
They can align with the Catholic Church on abortion and contraception, but they run into problems with other social justice issues. It really depends on if you're talking about conservative Catholics or progressive Catholics. 
Why should people who aren't evangelical Christians care about this faith group? 
They represent one-fifth to a quarter of the entire country. They are a large part of the Republican Party, and, to some extent, they run the party. Politically, they're very important. 
When they went for Trump, it made a big difference for the Trump campaign. 
Evangelical support for Trump came as a surprise to many Americans, including leaders within the evangelical Christian community. What happened? 
Nobody expected the vote to go for Trump, including leaders of the Christian right. During the early part of the primaries, 50 of them got together and decided who to vote for and, of course, they chose Ted Cruz, who they thought was the most plausible. After all, he's an evangelical and a Texas conservative. 
But then it turned out that only a minority of evangelicals voted for Cruz, which is fairly unprecedented. The evangelical world is splintering in many ways. 
Many right-wing evangelicals were part of the tea party, for example. And there's also a progressive left wing that didn't exist before 2005. 
And younger evangelicals tend to be more like the progressives. They're social-justice oriented. They haven't given up on (changing) abortion laws, but they tend to support homosexual rights and gay marriage. 
What will the splintering mean for the next election? 
It really depends on who runs. 
The changes are going to be incremental, because they're demographic. Young evangelicals don't vote as much as older people, but, as they grow older, they will. 
The splintering is going to continue. Right-wing evangelicals will join with the secular right, while progressive evangelicals join with people of other faiths and secular people over the issues they care about, like immigration. 
It may be that we won't be talking about an evangelical vote.

62,David Usborne,2017-11-21T19:59:58.008+02:00,"{'persons': [], 'organizations': [], 'locations': []}",[],,,english,0,2017-11-21T19:26:00.000+02:00,,"On its own, Donald Trump returning North Korea to the list of states sponsoring terrorism makes sense. One more gentle tightening of the vice on Pyongyang is the sort of move we’d expect from the United States at this perilous point: cautious and incremental. One more, ever-so-calculated move in a chess game where everyone is careful not to knock over any of the pieces.
Some have quibbled over whether it’s right to label Pyongyang a purveyor of terror just now. Trump, announcing the move at the start of a cabinet meeting, cited the assassination in Malaysia in February of Kim Jong-un’s half brother and the fate of American student Otto Warmbier. He died in June days after returning home from North Korea where he’d spent 17 months in prison.
Sceptics point out: none of that quite amounts to funding terror networks.
But otherwise, why not? North Korea was on the US State Department-administered list for 20 years before 2008 when George W Bush removed it, hoping the gesture would cement a tentative deal which, at the time, was meant to see some fresh aid flow to Pyongyang, in exchange for the regime halting its nuclear arms programme. It didn’t. Because Pyongyang didn’t. You might almost call the US action belated. Most happy to see it will be Japan, which told Trump on his recent visit that it wants as strong a line as possible against Kim. The slightly more tremulous South Korea might welcome it too, because re-listing North Korea is also mostly symbolic. Any nation that finds itself on the list – already there are Syria, Sudan and Iran – is automatically slapped with US sanctions. In North Korea’s case, they are already in place.
So far, so good. But there is a problem which should be pretty clear to all of us. This is a chess game in which both players, not just one of them, are highly unpredictable and volatile.
Nothing that increases the chances of one of them suddenly snapping seems like a good idea. Knocking over a few bishops and kings in this scenario could translate into obliterating whole nations.
If rhetoric is a forecaster of anything real, we’d surely be in trouble. Trump has publicly indicated a willingness to “totally destroy” the entire north half of the Korean peninsula with “fire and fury” if Kim threatens the US. Kim has been a little more restrained, limiting himself to a fatwa declaring that “hideous criminal” Trump has been “sentenced to death by the Korean people”.
Another slight cause for concern: do grown-up, calibrating chess masters normally indulge in the juvenilia favoured by these two? Trump calls Kim “short and fat”, and “rocket-man”. Kim calls Trump a “gangster”, a “frightened dog” and a “dotard”. There’s more, but you get the tenor.
Trump is not really crazy, of course. Let’s cling to that. Yet, you don’t have to look too far in the US today for symptoms of deep unease about what he might be capable of. A week ago, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, controlled by Republicans, held a hearing on whether Congress should consider legislation to curb the ability of a sitting president to launch nuclear missiles.
“We are concerned that the President of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear strike that is wildly out of step with US interests,” warned Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat.
Pause for a moment and just consider what he was saying. Others on the Hill have also questioned the wisdom of leaving Trump alone at nights with the nuclear codes, among them Republican Senator Bob Corker.
Still more extraordinary was the admission last week from the top US nuclear commander that he would ignore an order to launch nuclear-tipped missiles by Trump if he considered them illegal. Air Force General John Hyten, commander of the Strategic Command (Stratcom), acknowledged it was something he’d been giving thought to.
“I provide advice to the President, he will tell me what to do,” he said in remarks at a security conference in Nova Scotia, Canada. “And if it’s illegal, guess what’s going to happen? I’m going to say, ‘Mr. President, that’s illegal.’”
We want to trust Trump’s ability to get us through this without triggering a nuclear calamity, the likes of which the world has never seen. We have to. But all this makes it more difficult. As do newly surfaced reports of HR McMaster, the National Security Advisor, purportedly telling guests at a dinner party that Trump had the intelligence of a “kindergartner”. A spokesman as denied he said such a thing. Didn’t Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State, call him a “moron” in private?
It is because we can be sure of so little – that this situation is so fragile – that anything that risks pushing either side to take military action should be avoided. That includes slapping Pyongyang with the state-sponsored terrorism label. It is, in fact, a bad idea, because the evidence to justify it is thin at best. That makes the US look like its breaking – or at least, bending – the rules of the game to suit its own purposes.

Never miss a chance to smear conservatives, even if that means somehow connecting the right to the murderous cult leader Charles Manson. That’s apparently the view of the New York Times and Newsweek . Both liberal outlets on Monday used Manson’s death to attack political enemies. A tweet for the NYT opinion piece by Baynard Woods slimed, “ Charles Manson wasn't the inevitable outgrowth of the Sixties. If anything, he was a harbinger of today's far right.” 
Woods insisted that the killer “had more in common ideologically with far-right groups like the John Birch Society than he did with the anarchic leftism of, say, the Yippies.” Desperately trying to connect Manson to conservatives, he argued: 
[Manson] believed that African-Americans would soon rise up and begin to murder white people. Mr. Manson and his followers would be spared; they were going to hide beneath the desert in Death Valley until the war was over, when they would surface from their underground layer and rule over the black population, which, Mr. Manson claimed, would be unable to govern itself. 
... 
Today, this sort of logic is all too familiar to us. The paranoid, racist and apocalyptic ramblings of Mr. Manson are the DNA of the reactionary alt-right. In the days leading up to Dylann Roof’s murder of nine black parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., he talked to his friends about a “race war” and later used the same language in interviews with investigators. He was an enthusiastic reader of alt-right websites. 
Memo to the New York Times : Monsters like Manson and Dylann Roof aren’t ""the right."" 
Newsweek’s Melissa Matthews on Monday talked to psychoanalyst Mark Smaller about how cult leader Manson can help understand Trump and his supporters: 
Smaller is clear that he does not believe President Donald Trump is similar to the convicted killer, or that their followers have any shared beliefs or characteristics, but he did say we can look to the current president to see how language is used to form a bond with followers. 
“Our current president speaks in an emotional or affective way to large numbers of people in our country who feel a kind of alienation or disconnection from the government,” he said. “They feel very responded to and become his political base.” <<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>> DONATE 
In case it wasn’t clear enough, the headline connected the dots: “ How Murderer Charles Manson and Donald Trump Used Language to Gain Followers.” 
Is it possible, liberal journalists, that the rantings of a depraved cult leader/murderer don’t tell us anything about conservatives?","{'uuid': 'e9e7416cdb35798a259d7b43b0019d80d780658f', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC9N4hvdwMd872XCficqVJQYG34wPGroWO17JQizrM6T690gbQcPPBuB.tia.X1xbNdTIZC2GaRr6w7JNVDY6SrtMONcDo6gkvujmCv0tOqwyns8b8glt7EyccCl0hwzoEOg168J3VCp2smlujCsbUc8-', 'site_full': 'www.newsbusters.org', 'site': 'newsbusters.org', 'site_section': 'http://newsbusters.org/blog/feed', 'site_categories': [], 'section_title': 'NewsBusters', 'title': 'New York Times Slimes: Charles Manson ‘Was a Harbinger of Today’s Far Right’', 'title_full': 'New York Times Slimes: Charles Manson ‘Was a Harbinger of Today’s Far Right’', 'published': '2017-11-21T18:34:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'https://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/mansoncharles.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 15613, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",New York Times Slimes: Charles Manson ‘Was a Harbinger of Today’s Far Right’,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC9N4hvdwMd872XCficqVJQYG34wPGroWO17JQizrM6T690gbQcPPBuB.tia.X1xbNdTIZC2GaRr6w7JNVDY6SrtMONcDo6gkvujmCv0tOqwyns8b8glt7EyccCl0hwzoEOg168J3VCp2smlujCsbUc8-,e9e7416cdb35798a259d7b43b0019d80d780658f

The Palestinians have severed all contacts with officials from the Trump administration after it decided to close their official representation in Washington, dealing a blow to any potential resurrection of peace talks with Israel. 
Last week, the State Department declined to renew the permit for the office operated by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Washington. 
“What is the use of holding any meetings with them when they close our office? Our meetings begin from our office, and the arrangements are there,” Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Malki told AFP. 
“In practice by closing the office they are freezing all meetings and we are making that official.” 
A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) confirmed that it had received instructions from Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas “regarding closing down all communication lines with the Americans”. 
The PLO, which the international community sees as representing all Palestinians, must have its permission to operate premises in the US capital renewed by the State Department every six months. 
But last week the department refused to renew the permit. 
US officials cited comments by Abbas about possibly taking Israel to the International Criminal Court. 
In 2015, the US Congress introduced a provision that Palestinians may not try to wield influence over the ICC concerning investigations into Israelis. 
The US consulate in Jerusalem declined to comment on Tuesday, instead referring back to a statement on Saturday which said it was hopeful that any “closure will be short-lived,” 
“We are not cutting off relations with the PLO,” that statement said. 
The declaration does not automatically mean the mission will close. 
US President Donald Trump now has a 90-day window to decide whether “the Palestinians have entered into direct, meaningful negotiations with Israel”— in which case he can waive the requirement to shutter the office.

Senator Al Franken has been removed from a PBS program that aired nationally as a tribute to former CBS Late Night host and comedian David Letterman on Monday at 8 p.m. 
After noting that “Franken participated in the event,” the network stated that he “will not appear substantially in the PBS program” because his inclusion “at this time would distract from the show's purpose as a celebration of American humor."" 
According to an article by Kimberly Nordyke of the Hollywood Reporter website, the Democratic official was removed from the “updated” special, which is entitled David Letterman: The Mark Twain Prize , because PBS and WETA -- the producing television station that covers the Washington, D.C., area -- since the Minnesota senator was accused of sexual harassment last week . 
“Every year, this program is edited for both length and content to keep it entertaining and focused on its intended purpose as a celebration of American humor ,” the statement added. 
The segment originally featured Franken thanking Letterman in “a post-retirement series of videos that he and Letterman recorded together designed to raise awareness on climate change.” 
However, KABC radio anchor Leeann Tweeden claimed that Franken kissed and groped her without her permission while returning from a tour to entertain troops in the Middle East for the United Service Organizations (USO) in 2006. 
The assertion was supported by a picture of Franken posing with his hands on her breasts while she was asleep during the plane flight back to the U.S. 
Shortly after Tweeden's first-person essay was posted online, Franken released a statement through his press office extending his ""sincerest apologies to Leeann,"" he said. ""As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't . I shouldn't have done it."" 
“Franken then released a lengthier second statement” in which he called for an ethics investigation of himself and “vowed to cooperate fully” with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. 
The Minnesota Democrat also noted: 
The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women. 
There's more I want to say, but the first and most important thing -- and if it's the only thing you care to hear, that's fine -- is: ""I'm sorry."" 
The PBS event was held last month at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington to commemorate the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, which is named after the 19th century novelist, essayist and humorist and “is presented to an individual who has made a significant contribution to America humor.” 
In addition, the prize is presented by several of the honoree’s peers and is a significant fund-raiser for the Kennedy Center. 
The Associated Press covered the event by indicating that “several of the comedians honoring Letterman took shots at President Donald Trump and the general state of the country. More than one comedian quipped that the Kennedy Center's funding was about to be cut off mid-show. ” 
Jimmy Kimmel, host of ABC’s late night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live , jokingly blamed Letterman for helping to bring Trump to power. ""It's like you went out for cigarettes one day and left us in the hands of our abusive, orange stepfather,” he joked. 
He also praised Letterman profusely , recalling a monologue he delivered on his show shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York City and the Pentagon. 
""You let us know it was OK to move on and OK to laugh again,"" Kimmel said. ""Dave, you led the way for all of us."" 
The 70-year-old Letterman spent 33 years on late-night TV, hosting long-running shows on NBC and then on CBS. His final broadcast aired on May 20, 2015, and exceeded the record of his mentor, Johnny Carson. 
NBC gave Letterman his own show following Carson beginning on Feb. 1, 1982. Late Night With David Letterman debuted with first guest Bill Murray, the Twain award recipient in 2016. 
Letterman ended the evening with a brief speech and a bit of dark humor, saying: ""I kind of wish this award could be presented posthumously."" 
He also thanked the ""hundreds and hundreds, perhaps thousands"" of people who helped him along the way and closed the event with a politically tinged quote from Mark Twain himself on the subject of patriotism: “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time and supporting your government when it deserves it.” 
Franken had not responded to the PBS announcement by Monday afternoon.","{'uuid': '20f6e83e9a9209a5fd5a1b7809026bb34281d4f6', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC9N4hvdwMd872XCficqVJQbbqw.6kdjJjzzBulPmjLOiKa_Gxi4wd4uZojFR0Q7TJI2vXUxJ4j.qNSA9lo48MC.RDJHw_AfdlYVcDtHrO.heuEXVbLENsPpkOzkIvTV5D1_5MamX0NkK', 'site_full': 'www.newsbusters.org', 'site': 'newsbusters.org', 'site_section': 'http://newsbusters.org/blog/feed', 'site_categories': [], 'section_title': 'NewsBusters', 'title': 'PBS Cuts Al Franken From Comedy Tribute Honoring David Letterman', 'title_full': 'PBS Cuts Al Franken From Comedy Tribute Honoring David Letterman', 'published': '2017-11-21T12:47:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'https://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/al-franken-david-letterman-mark-twain-prize.png', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 15613, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",PBS Cuts Al Franken From Comedy Tribute Honoring David Letterman,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC9N4hvdwMd872XCficqVJQbbqw.6kdjJjzzBulPmjLOiKa_Gxi4wd4uZojFR0Q7TJI2vXUxJ4j.qNSA9lo48MC.RDJHw_AfdlYVcDtHrO.heuEXVbLENsPpkOzkIvTV5D1_5MamX0NkK,20f6e83e9a9209a5fd5a1b7809026bb34281d4f6

At the Associated Press on Friday, economics writer Paul Wiseman attempted to rewrite history, pretending that ""trickle down"" economics is a term Republicans have used for their economic plans since the days of Ronald Reagan, and that the current GOP tax plan which has made it through the House and is being considered by the Senate is more of the same thing. 
In fact, Reagan's policies, which were supply-side, growth-oriented and behavior-changing, did not cause only tiny amounts of money to ""trickle down"" to everyday Americans; they instead led to explosive and sustained employment and across-the-board income growth which hasn't been seen since. 
Wiseman began with deception, and kept it going during his entire writeup : 
Derided by critics, trickle-down economics gets another try 
Does money roll downhill? 
In their drive to cut taxes, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are betting it does. 
Behind their legislation is a theory long popular among conservatives: Slash taxes for corporations and rich people, who will then hire, invest and profit — and cause money to trickle into the pockets of ordinary Americans. The White House says the plan's corporate tax cut alone would eventually raise average household incomes by $4,000 a year. 
The tax plan's ""trickle-down"" approach was popularized in the 1980s during the Reagan administration, though it dates back at least to a 1932 wisecrack by Will Rogers. And history shows it has a spotty record of delivering on its promises. 
Wiseman's LinkedIn profile indicates that he's old enough to know that he's using the term Reagan's opponents used to describe his economic plan, but is pretending that the GOP has used that same term for the past 3-1/2 decades. What rubbish. 
In fact, as a journalism major at Indiana University who graduated in 1983, he must surely be aware that David Stockman, Reagan's first Director Office of Management and Budget, erroneously characterized Reagan's tax plan as ""trickle down"" in a controversial Atlantic Magazine interview in December 1981. When it appeared, it was all anyone talked about for at least a week, even though Stockman's ignorant remarks came 6 and 18 months, respectively, before the second and third phases of the Economic Recovery Tax Act's individual tax cuts even took effect. Stockman completely misunderstood the objective of Reagan's supply-side tax cuts and grossly mischaracterized them. (At that point, how could even have known their ultimate effect?) 
Reagan's tax cuts were designed to grow the economy and make everyone significantly better off. They succeeded marvelously. Once the cuts were fully in place, the economy left the July 1981-November 1982 recession in the dust: Quarterly Gross Domestic Product growth averaged an annualized 6.7 percent during 1983 and 1984, and almost 4 percent during the next 16 quarters. The six years of annual growth averaging 4.4 percent seen from 1983 to 1988 has not been matched or exceeded during the past 28 years. The closest six-year average since then, from 1994 to 2000, was only 4.0%. (The past seven officially recession-free years during the Obama administration only averaged 2.1 percent.) Real median household income grew by almost 13 percent from 1983 to 1989 (over $6,000 in today's dollars). Every major percentile group, from the lowest to the highest, had real double-digit percentage gains. From the end of 1982 to the end of 1989, seasonally adjusted payroll employment grew by 20 million, going from from 88.8 million to 108.8 million, a 22.5 percent increase . No 7-year period since has seen such a high percentage of payroll job growth. 
Despite these results, Wiseman predictably went to a far-left expert to pretend that supply-side economics doesn't really work: In the view of Carl Davis, research director at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), the track record for supply-side economics ""is not particularly inspiring."" 
This is how loopy-left ITEP is, as seen at its ""About"" page : ITEP, along with its c(4)partner, Citizens for Tax Justice, became a nationally known voice for tax fairness after analyzing the effects of the 1981 tax cuts under President Reagan and demonstrating that ordinary families, in fact, experienced a net tax increase. 
ITEP must think that the median and percentile group income gains retrieved from the Census Bureau and cited above are all made up. The fact is that the Reagan tax cuts completely ""removed 4 million working poor from the tax rolls; they no longer paid any federal income tax,"" and lowered the federal income tax burden on lower middle-class families to a microscopic level. 
Wiseman's insistence on describing Reaganomics as trickle-down, and then pretending that Republicans routinely employ the term, is especially risible. As John Hinderaker at Powerline noted on Friday , ""no significant Republican"" uses the term. <<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>> DONATE 
Hinderaker understands Democrats' fundamental motivation: What will happen if pro-growth policies are actually enacted and signed into law? The sky is the limit. That is why White House press correspondents and Democratic Party news outlets like the Associated Press are desperately trying to block Republican tax proposals from being enacted into law. 
Based on the positive effect they have had on the economy's performance during the past two quarters. Trump's efforts to rein in regulation are already starting to look like the equivalent of a modest tax cut. 
If Congress passes genuine tax reform as currently designed, the sum of that and Trump's deregulatory efforts could lead to the strongest economy we've seen in almost two decades. That the Democrats are trying desperately to stop tax reform tells us all we need to know about their priorities: Party first, country second.","{'uuid': '384f0d8a5008de9526aea451f7d2685b2f1ad213', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC9N4hvdwMd872XCficqVJQYzkjAOq6mQQZaB0mpHejIRfe_2DMEaoOag1J4sbqaucfeLqm3ZgKNcwy0o775TPc.VIsUf.iWgjSY_ljBJnvzOpTgKpjT2SMf_JrJ5fj9ZEw--', 'site_full': 'www.newsbusters.org', 'site': 'newsbusters.org', 'site_section': 'http://newsbusters.org/blog/feed', 'site_categories': [], 'section_title': 'NewsBusters', 'title': ""AP's Paul Wiseman Smears GOP Tax Plan as 'Trickle Down'"", 'title_full': ""AP's Paul Wiseman Smears GOP Tax Plan as 'Trickle Down'"", 'published': '2017-11-21T06:56:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'https://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/reaganexplainingtaxes1980s.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 15613, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",AP's Paul Wiseman Smears GOP Tax Plan as 'Trickle Down',http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC9N4hvdwMd872XCficqVJQYzkjAOq6mQQZaB0mpHejIRfe_2DMEaoOag1J4sbqaucfeLqm3ZgKNcwy0o775TPc.VIsUf.iWgjSY_ljBJnvzOpTgKpjT2SMf_JrJ5fj9ZEw--,384f0d8a5008de9526aea451f7d2685b2f1ad213

By MATTHEW PENNINGTONAssociated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration readied new sanctions Tuesday on North Korea, a day after declaring it a state sponsor of terrorism in a move to put additional pressure on Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
North Korea has joined Iran, Sudan and Syria on America's terror blacklist, a largely symbolic step as the administration already has the authority to impose virtually any sanctions it wants on Kim Jong Un's government over its nuclear weapons development. 
As part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign, President Donald Trump said the Treasury Department would impose more sanctions on North Korea and ""related persons"" starting Tuesday, without hinting who or what would be targeted. The move is part of rolling effort to deprive Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs and leave it internationally isolated. 
""It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it's finished over a two-week period,"" Trump said. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday the pressure campaign was starting to bite in Pyongyang, which is already facing unprecedented U.N.-mandated sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Tillerson said anecdotal evidence and intelligence suggests the North is now suffering fuel shortages, with queues at gas stations, and its revenues are down. 
The United States has been applying sanctions of its own as well. 
In Tokyo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the move, telling reporters Japan supports the step as a way to increase pressure on North Korea. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang expressed concern. 
Lu said Tuesday that the situation is ""highly sensitive"" and that it would be ""helpful to bring all parties back to the negotiation table instead of doing the opposite."" 
Da Zhigang, a North Korea expert at the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said the move ""will arouse diplomatic reactions and hatred toward the U.S. from North Korea"" and could even prompt the North to resume missile tests. 
An editorial Tuesday in North Korea's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called Trump a ""heinous criminal"" who had insulted the dignity of the country's supreme leadership and its socialist system during his recent visit to South Korea. The editorial, carried by the state-run news agency, threatened ""merciless punishment."" It did not mention the terror designation. 
In September, Trump opened the way for the U.S. to punish foreign companies dealing with North Korea. He issued an executive order expanding the Treasury Department's ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with the North, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system. 
Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow on Northeast Asia at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Treasury could be preparing more designations against North Korean entities related to the terrorism listing, or possibly Chinese or other companies violating the September order. 
A potential target would be Chinese banks that serve as North Korea's conduit to the international system. Such a move would irk Beijing, whose help Trump is counting on to put an economic squeeze on Pyongyang. China recently sent its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years to discuss the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula. 
Tillerson urged China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's external trade, to take unilateral steps to cut fuel supplies to its wayward neighbor. China, which is calling for dialogue to ease the nuclear tensions, is reluctant to exert economic pressure that could destabilize the North. 
Tillerson acknowledged a two-month pause in the North's rapid tempo of nuclear and missile tests and said there was still hope for diplomacy. With tougher sanctions in the offing, he warned Kim, ""This is only going to get worse until you're ready to come and talk."" 
The terror designation, however, is likely to exacerbate sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim. North Korea shows no interest in talks aimed at getting it to give up its nukes. 
North Korea has been on and off the terror list over the years. It was designated for two decades because of its involvement in international terror attacks in the 1980s, then taken off in 2008 to smooth the way for nuclear talks that soon failed.

LOS ANGELES — Kathy Griffin says she is in the middle of a “Hollywood blacklist” after taking a photo holding a fake severed head that resembled President Donald Trump. 
The comedian is currently on a world standup tour. She says in a YouTube video that when she returns to the U.S. she doesn’t have “one single day of paid work” scheduled. She says she doesn’t want to do free shows or work small clubs and thinks she should be able to get her life back. 
Griffin says the Trump photo “offended a lot of people,” but added: “this wall of crap has never fallen on any woman in the history of America like it has on me.” 
Griffin initially apologized for the photo published in May before saying she was no longer sorry over the summer.

Photo: Bloomberg At a recent conference I attended, I was seated next to a prominent American trade policy expert. We began to talk about the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which President Donald Trump has blamed for American workers’ woes and is trying to renegotiate. “I never thought Nafta was a big deal,” the economist said.
I was astonished. The expert had been one of the most prominent and vocal advocates of Nafta when the deal was concluded a quarter-century ago. He and other trade economists had played a big part in selling the agreement to the American public. “I supported Nafta because I thought it would pave the way for further trade agreements,” my companion explained.
A couple of weeks later, I was at a dinner in Europe, where the speaker was a former finance minister of a eurozone country. The topic was the rise of populism. The former minister had left politics and had strong words about the mistakes he thought the European policy elite had made. “We accuse populists of making promises they cannot keep, but we should turn that criticism back on ourselves,” he told us.
Earlier during the dinner, I had discussed what I describe as a trilemma, whereby it is impossible to have national sovereignty, democracy, and hyper-globalization all at once. We must choose two out of three. The former politician spoke passionately: “Populists are at least honest. They are clear about the choice they are making; they want the nation-state, and not hyper-globalization or the European single market. But we told our people they could have all three cakes simultaneously. We made promises we could not deliver.”
We will never know whether greater honesty on the part of mainstream politicians and technocrats would have spared us the rise of nativist demagogues like Trump or Marine Le Pen in France. What is clear is that lack of candour in the past has come at a price. It has cost political movements of the centre their credibility.
Many elites are puzzled about why poor or working-class people would vote for someone like Trump. After all, the professed economic policies of Hillary Clinton would in all likelihood have proved more favourable to them. To explain the apparent paradox, they cite these voters’ ignorance, irrationality, or racism.
But there is another explanation, one that is fully consistent with rationality and self-interest. When mainstream politicians lose their credibility, it is natural for voters to discount the promises they make. Voters are more likely to be attracted to candidates who have anti-establishment credentials and can safely be expected to depart from prevailing policies.
In the language of economists, centrist politicians face a problem of asymmetric information. They claim to be reformers, but why should voters believe leaders who appear no different from the previous crop of politicians who oversold them the gains from globalization and pooh-poohed their grievances?
In Clinton’s case, her close association with the globalist mainstream of the Democratic Party and close ties with the financial sector clearly compounded the problem. Her campaign promised fair trade deals and disavowed support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but was her heart really in it? After all, when she was US secretary of state, she had strongly backed the TPP.
This is what economists call a pooling equilibrium. Conventional and reformist politicians look alike and hence elicit the same response from much of the electorate. They lose votes to the populists and demagogues whose promises to shake up the system are more credible.
Framing the challenge as a problem of asymmetric information also hints at a solution. A pooling equilibrium can be disrupted if reformist politicians can “signal” to voters his or her “true type”.
Signalling has a specific meaning in this context. It means engaging in costly behaviour that is sufficiently extreme that a conventional politician would never want to emulate it, yet not so extreme that it would turn the reformer into a populist and defeat the purpose. For someone like Clinton, assuming her conversion was real, it could have meant announcing she would no longer take a dime from Wall Street or would not sign another trade agreement if elected.
In other words, centrist politicians who want to steal the demagogues’ thunder have to tread a very narrow path. If fashioning such a path sounds difficult, it is indicative of the magnitude of the challenge these politicians face. Meeting it will likely require new faces and younger politicians, not tainted with the globalist, market fundamentalist views of their predecessors.
It will also require forthright acknowledgement that pursuing the national interest is what politicians are elected to do. And this implies a willingness to attack many of the establishment’s sacred cows—particularly the free rein given to financial institutions, the bias toward austerity policies, the jaundiced view of government’s role in the economy, the unhindered movement of capital around the world, and the fetishization of international trade.
To mainstream ears, the rhetoric of such leaders will often sound jarring and extreme. Yet wooing voters back from populist demagogues may require nothing less. These politicians must offer an inclusive, rather than nativist, conception of national identity, and their politics must remain squarely within liberal democratic norms. Everything else should be on the table. ©2017/Project Syndicate

Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan is ""expressly and vehemently"" denying any wrongdoing following reports being made public this week that he settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015 after allegedly sexually harassing a staffer, according to an explosive report published Monday. 
""In our country, we strive to honor this fundamental principle that all are entitled to due process,"" Conyers said in a statement. ""In this case, I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me, and continue to do so."" 
BuzzFeed News obtained documents, which includes four signed affidavits, three of which are notarized, from former aides who allege that Conyers made sexual advances to female staff in his office. The repeated requests from Conyers, according to BuzzFeed, included sexual favors, inappropriate touching and transporting women who were believed to be having affairs with the congressman. 

BuzzFeed posted the documents online. CNN has not independently confirmed the allegations, or authenticated the documents. 
Conyers' former staffer, whose name is not revealed by BuzzFeed, filed the complaint with the Office of Compliance in 2014, which was set up in the 1990s to handle workplace disputes on Capitol Hill. The unnamed woman alleged that Conyers fired her for not accepting his sexual advances, which led to her more than $27,000 settlement. 
Conyers, who is the longest-serving active member of the House of Representatives, did not dispute the existence of settlement or payment, saying, ""My office resolved the allegations -- with an express denial of liability -- in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation. That should not be lost in the narrative. The resolution was not for millions of dollars, but rather for an amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment."" 
Notable in BuzzFeed's reporting is that unlike other complaints that are settled through the OOC process, the payout for this particular settlement was paid out from Conyers' congressional office budget, instead of the US Treasury fund set up for this purpose. 
CNN reported last week that just two members of Congress are typically responsible for signing off on such settlement payouts -- the chairman and ranking member of the House Administration Committee. It's unclear what role, if any, the committee played in the Conyers settlement. In the settlement, Conyers did not admit any fault. 
The process was ""disgusting,"" Matthew Peterson, who was the law clerk representing the complainant, told BuzzFeed. 
""It is a designed cover-up,"" Peterson said. ""You feel like they were betrayed by their government just for coming forward. It's like being abused twice."" 
In the documents, the former staffer alleges Conyers repeatedly asked her for sexual favors, as well as asked her to join him in a hotel room. 
She specifically referenced one occasion when she was asked by Conyers to work out of his room, but when she arrived, he started ""talking about his sexual desires,"" according to BuzzFeed. She said he then told her she needed to ""touch it,"" referencing his penis, or find him a woman who would. 
""Rep. Conyers strongly postulated that the performing of personal service or favors would be looked upon favorably and lead to salary increases or promotions,"" the former staffer said in the documents. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement Tuesday morning saying he read a report of a sexual harassment claim against a member of the House of Representatives, but didn't specifically cite the BuzzFeed report. An aide later confirmed to CNN the statement was in regards to Conyers. 
""This report is extremely troubling,"" he said in a statement. ""Last month, I directed the Committee on House Administration to conduct a full review of all policies and procedures related to workplace harassment and discrimination ... People who work in the House deserve and are entitled to a workplace without harassment or discrimination."" 
House Democratic Leader Nany Pelosi told BuzzFeed she was unaware of the settlement. A spokesman for former House Speaker John Boehner told CNN that Boehner was ""not aware"" of the Conyers settlement ""until Buzzfeed inquired about it"" Monday. The Boehner spokesman also tells CNN that ""the Speaker's office was not given access to"" any OOC settlements during Boehner's time as Speaker. CNN has reached out to Pelosi for comment. 
BuzzFeed acquired the documents from Mike Cernovich, a blogger who surfaced on the political scene last year as a staunch supporter of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. He gained notoriety as an online troll who peddled conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton's health, among other things, frequently drawing ire from both conservatives and liberals alike for making inflammatory comments on a host of issues. 
BuzzFeed News reported it independently verified the documents provided by Cernovich. 
Last week, the Office of Compliance released additional information indicating that it has paid more than $17 million in settlements since 1997. That includes all settlements, not just related to sexual harassment, but also discrimination and other cases. 
An OOC spokeswoman said the office was releasing the extra data ""due to the interest in the awards and settlement figures."" The OOC has come under fire in recent days for what lawmakers and Hill aides alike say are its antiquated policies that do not adequately protect victims who file complaints.

According to officials, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj directly spoke with her counterparts from nearly 60 countries to push Bhandari's case.
In the run up to the re-election, India made intense positive campaign regarding the candidature. It raised the issue at every possible meeting at various levels, an official said.
At the highest level also, the prime minister raised the issue during his meetings with world leaders, the official said.
""India never indulged in the negative campaign. It was run on the strength of our candidate and strength of India strong constitutional system,"" an official said.
In what was described by India as one of its ""biggest diplomatic victories"" in the multilateral arena, Bhandari received 183 of the 193 votes in the General Assembly and secured all 15 votes in the Security Council to fill the final vacancy on the Hague-based International Court of Justice after separate but simultaneous elections were held at the UN headquarters here.
Bhandari, 70, was declared re-elected for a fresh nine- year term at the ICJ after Britain withdrew its candidate Christopher Greenwood from the race about an hour before the scheduled voting.
According to observers, Bhandari's victory has sent a strong message to the leading powers about the winds of change in the world and underscored the point that India is now a force to reckon with.
The ICJ has a bench of 15 judges, five of whom are elected every three years for a nine-year term. To be elected, the candidate needed majority in both the chambers.
Established in 1945, the role of the ICJ is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by states and to give advisory opinions on legal questions.
Soon after the election results were announced, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Syed Akbaruddin was congratulated by representatives of other countries on the floor of the General Assembly.
""Vande Matram - India wins election to the International Court of Justice. JaiHind,"" tweeted External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.
In the previous 11 rounds of voting, Bhandari had consistently polled nearly two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly.
With Bhandari's election, Britain will not have a judge on the world court's 15-member panel for the first time.
Also for the first time in 70 years, a permanent member of the Security Council lost to a non-permanent member for a seat in the ICJ.
The British move to block voting in the Security Council and go for the joint consultation mechanism, which was last used some 96 years ago, also fell flat yesterday.
This is because, many of the Security Council members including some Permanent Members which were consistently supporting Britain in the secret ballot, backed off from voting in favour of the UK move to stop next rounds of voting as this required open voting, observers said.
""It is actually perhaps the biggest diplomatic victory we have in a multilateral arena,"" a long-time friend of India at the United Nations said.
In a dramatic move, British Permanent Representative to the UN Matthew Rycroft wrote identical letters to the presidents of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council before the two chambers were scheduled to meet at 3 pm (local time) for the 12th round of voting.
Rycroft said in his letter the current deadlock is unlikely to be broken by further rounds of voting and the UK therefore has decided to withdraw Greenwood's nomination.
""In taking this step, we have borne in mind the close relationship that the United Kingdom and India have always enjoyed and we will continue to enjoy...,"" Rycroft said.
Noting that Britain is a major player in the UN system, sources said the ""signal to all the membership is clear that Indians are now a force to reckon with"".
According to informed sources, three hours before the voting, General Assembly President Miroslav Lajcak and Italian Ambassador Sebastiano Cardi in his capacity as Security Council President for the month of November convened a consultative meeting with the Permanent Representative of the UK to the UN Rycroft and Akbaruddin.
India refused to budge against any kind of pressure and insisted to complete the democratic process, sources said.
It was unclear what transpired in the next two hours that forced Britain to withdraw from the race.
In Washington, US President Donald Trump in between had a meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his Indian- origin Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.
It is learnt that many of the Britain's supporters at this point of time clearly told them that they would vote for Greenwood only in a secret ballot but could not be seen voting in open against India and that too at a time when two-thirds of the world community was backing New Delhi.
Reading the writing on the wall, Britain decided to withdraw from the race, sources said.
At the start of the General Assembly and the Security Council meeting both Lajcak and Cardi read similar letters from Rycroft informing them about UK's decision to withdraw from the race.
Thereafter Lajcak and Cardi announced to complete the rest of the election process by having the name of just Bhandari on the ballot. Soon Bhandari was declared elected.
In the last 10 days, it is learnt that India mounted an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to win the ICJ seat.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is believed to have taken up the matter with some of the world leaders.
After Bhandari's re-election, he congratulated him and said: ""His re-election is a proud moment for us"".
He also expressed gratitude to the members of the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council for ""their support and trust in India.""","{'uuid': 'e1954def165f42f9289604e96605608abfe98070', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8MhJEbIk6Hp4_GAaXVPzclivdEYLxFyLBbWdkpCxh5Ipi6tJb6kGI5TY4rWL94e3.V6a9garNne_tFyypr23kNqfxZprGxezB13Y_n8tb4ZSfxn03AxXowV3SQmDspo0taQNRc_m.ZUynOaK8PvgFhbsh78XDfRrALzenTXlvat1TqIhbj5BwB01kBOp4MQek-', 'site_full': 'www.dnaindia.com', 'site': 'dnaindia.com', 'site_section': 'http://www.dnaindia.com/services/rss/news-latest.xml', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'Latest News', 'title': 'Herculean effort behind ICJ win: MEA reached out to 175 countries, Swaraj spoke to 60 of her counterparts', 'title_full': 'Herculean effort behind ICJ win: MEA reached out to 175 countries, Swaraj spoke to 60 of her counterparts | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis', 'published': '2017-11-22T05:41:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'SG', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/21/626579-swaraj-reuters.jpg', 'performance_score': 10, 'domain_rank': 1715, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 1180, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 1180}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}","Herculean effort behind ICJ win: MEA reached out to 175 countries, Swaraj spoke to 60 of her counterparts",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8MhJEbIk6Hp4_GAaXVPzclivdEYLxFyLBbWdkpCxh5Ipi6tJb6kGI5TY4rWL94e3.V6a9garNne_tFyypr23kNqfxZprGxezB13Y_n8tb4ZSfxn03AxXowV3SQmDspo0taQNRc_m.ZUynOaK8PvgFhbsh78XDfRrALzenTXlvat1TqIhbj5BwB01kBOp4MQek-,e1954def165f42f9289604e96605608abfe98070

A planned takeover of Time Warner, the US media giant that owns TV networks including HBO and CNN, by telecoms giant AT&T is at risk after the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit claiming that the merger, one of the largest media deals ever announced, would reduce competition and lead to higher consumer prices. 
The move comes amid reports of possible political interference after Donald Trump, the US president who has been a critic of CNN, objected to the deal during the presidential campaign last year, saying that it would not be approved “in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” 
The DoJ has claimed that the deal, valued at over $85 billion, would harm US consumers, saying: “It would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy.” 
However, AT&T called the lawsuit “a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent,” with David McAtee, its general counsel, adding: “Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently.” 
If approved, AT&T would add Time Warner’s premium content, including live sport, to its distribution network of 130 million mobile phone customers and 25 million pay-television subscribers. 
Time Warner’s assets include television channel TNT, which holds live rights to the National Basketball Association until the end of the 2024-25 season, TBS, which shows Major League Baseball games in a deal running to 2021, and HBO, which offers pay-per-view boxing. 
In addition, Time Warner subsidiary Turner Sports owns Bleacher Report, the sports news portal which operates the official websites of the NBA, the PGA of America and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. 
In 2015, AT&T paid $48.5 billion to acquire DirecTV, the satellite television broadcaster, which owns the Sunday Ticket package of rights to NFL American football games in a deal worth $12 billion over eight years.

Washington: US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone for about an hour on Tuesday. 
A White House official said they covered topics including Syria, Ukraine, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan, a White House official said. 
It comes a day after Putin met with Syrian President Bashar Assad. 
Putin hosted Assad at a Black Sea resort ahead of a summit later this week with Russia, Turkey and Iran, the ABC reported.

When President Donald Trump said in February that Sweden was experiencing “problems like they never thought possible” because of unchecked migration by refugees into the European Union, it didn’t take long for the media to jump all over the president. 
Just look at the headlines: “‘Sweden, who would believe this ?’: Trump cites non-existent terror attack” (the London Guardian , apparently mistaking it for a comment on terror); “Trump baffles Sweden with crime comment, says it was based on TV report” ( Reuters ); “John Oliver to other countries: no, we don’t know what Trump is talking about either” ( Vox — because when you want to be ushered past the other side of the facts in a hurry, you go to John Oliver). 
Boy, that whole Sweden thing was just absolute fear-mongering, wasn’t it guys? I mean, it’s not like the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention released a study almost nine months to the day later showing violent crime in the Scandinavian country had reached a record level or anything, right? Advertisement - story continues below 
Oh wait, yes, it totally did. In fact, in statistics released last week, it showed that violent crime in almost every major category had jumped to its highest level since measurements began back in 2006. Give the public a break – The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!

A total of 15.6 percent of Swedish people suffered a offense against the person — assault, fraud, harassment, robbery, sexual offenses or threats — in 2016, up from 13.3 percent in 2015, according to Bloomberg. 
Historically, that percentage “was at a relatively stable level 2005 to 2014, at 11.3 percent to 13.1 percent, but the last two years show an increase,” the report from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention says. The crimes “that have had the clearest development in the past few years are harassment , fraud and sexual offenses.” Advertisement - story continues below 
“Young women aged 16-24 are the most vulnerable to sexual offenses,” a computer translation of the statement reads, noting “14 percent of young women reported that they had been subjected to at least one such crime in 2016. 
“Among men in the same age group, 1.2 percent reported that they had been exposed,” it read. 
Of the six types of offenses to the person tracked by the agency, five reached the highest levels ever reported. Only assault didn’t rise to the highest-level yet, instead settling for second-highest. 
So, see? It could have been worse! Advertisement - story continues below 
Perhaps most notable is that property offenses are actually well down from 2006, although they rose slightly last year. 
Now, tell me: What changes have you noticed in Sweden recently? Specifically, over the two-year period in which the study is measuring? RELATED: Former Heisman Winner and Football Star Lays Waste to Anthem Kneelers, Goodell 
The study assiduously avoids it, not noting any possible causes for the rise. So does Bloomberg. However, I think most people could think of one thing that could cause this: unchecked immigration of individuals whose criminal backgrounds are completely unknown and unknowable. 
I don’t know. Just a theory — a theory which a certain president was heavily criticized for making just nine months ago. Advertisement - story continues below

What makes a good presidential turkey? Showmanship. A readiness to strut his stuff and gobble on command, yet enough restraint to stay on a table for the big photo op. 
So say a Minnesota turkey farmer and 4-H kids who raised the turkey that will go to the White House for an official pardon from President Donald Trump on Tuesday. It's the 70th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey tradition. Here's a little deeper look at the event and what goes into it: 
THE TRADITION 
White House archives show that Americans have sent presidents holiday turkeys at least since 1873 under President Ulysses S. Grant. But the National Thanksgiving Turkey dates from 1947, when the National Turkey Federation became the official supplier and presented a 47-pound gobbler to President Harry Truman. In those days the turkeys were destined for dinner. 
Formal pardons began with President George H.W. Bush in 1989, though stories of spared turkeys date back to President Abraham Lincoln. President John F. Kennedy sent his 1963 turkey back to its farm. Sometime around the Nixon era the White House began sending them to petting zoos after the ceremonies, though without formal pardons. 
MINNESOTA'S GOBBLERS 
The perk of taking presidential turkeys to Washington goes to the chairman of the National Turkey Federation. This year that's Carl Wittenburg, from the Minnesota town of Alexandria. 
Wittenburg recruited five Douglas County 4-H members to help. They're the same teens he and his wife, Sharlene, mentored to a second-place finish in the statewide 4-H Science of Agriculture Challenge this summer with a project on turkey bedding. None of the girls had worked with turkeys before. Now they're all going to the White House to help oversee the bird, though Wittenburg's 19-year-old son, Wyatt, will lift it up onto the table. 
The Wittenburgs grow more than 100,000 turkeys annually for Northern Pride Cooperative in Wyndmere, North Dakota, but they raised the presidential flock on their smaller hobby farm near Alexandria. The birds hatched in late June. The star and an understudy who would step in if there's a last-minute problem will be around 47 and 37 pounds (21 and 17 kilograms) respectively by pardoning time. 
THE CHALLENGES 
The goal is getting the turkeys used to people. Teaching them to stay on the table and behave is the key, said Katie Kent, 18. The birds are hand-fed grub worms as bribes. 
""We're getting them used to being on that table and getting them to gobble and strut on command,"" said Kodi Bundermann, 17. 
Strutting for a turkey means fanning out his tail feathers and puffing out his body feathers. Toms do it to look good to the hens, Wittenburg said. Gobbling also is a male behavior; females click or cluck. It's hard to get turkeys to strut on command, he said, but they'll gobble nine times out of 10. 
The 4-Hers also play them music. They seem to like country, said Christina Kuismi, 16. 
""They love anything shiny, or even the ends of shoelaces, which are a little shiny,"" Kuismi said. ""They like to untie shoelaces. They've gotten really good at it."" 
Another challenge for the ceremony is that turkeys are very easily distracted, she said. 
""They're just very easily entertained,"" she said. ""They just want to go everywhere and see everything and explore."" 
THE STARS 
The team selected the two best birds from a flock of about 20, They looked for showmanship and character with an absence of any stage fright, Wittenburg said. They wanted turkeys that would strut and gobble for the cameras and the president yet remain calm on the table, he said. 
The birds got officially named Drumstick and Wishbone on Monday, and the White House opened a Twitter poll on which one Trump should pardon. They stayed at a hotel near the White House for the run-up to the big show. A flock-mate was pardoned by Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton on Friday. 
The presidential birds will finish out their lives in leisure at Virginia Tech, joining the 2016 winners, Tater and Tot, at Gobbler's Rest in Blacksburg. With luck, they might live another year or more. A few of their predecessors have hit the ripe old age of 2. Very few domestic turkeys live that long. The vast majority get sent to processing plants when they're between 14 to 20 weeks old. 
THE RISKS 
Pardons have not always gone smoothly and gratitude is not guaranteed. 
In 2001, a turkey named Liberty pecked President George W. Bush in the midsection — some reports say his crotch — drawing laughs from the crowd and an awkward expression from the president's face. 
Another memorable photo shows a grimacing President Ronald Reagan getting a face full of feathers when the 1984 turkey started flapping its wings. A turkey also flapped around on Reagan before jumping off the table and strutting around the White House lawn in 1981. 
TURKEY FACTS 
Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, with 450 farmers raising about 46 million turkeys this year. North Carolina is No. 2. They're among six states that account for nearly two-thirds of U.S. turkey production. The others are Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri and Virginia. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that farmers will raise nearly 245 million turkeys this year. The National Turkey Federation estimates that Americans will eat about 46 million for Thanksgiving, 22 million at Christmas and 19 million for Easter. But most turkeys are destined to become deli meat, sausage and other products.

Her latest book, ""The Evangelicals,"" explores one of America's most prominent faith groups. Kelsey Dallas, Deseret News 
Frances FitzGerald has a knack for timing. 
Curiosity brought her to Jerry Falwell's church in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1979, on the cusp of a political revolution. The evangelical leader was about to launch the Moral Majority, which helped conservative Christians become a major political force. 
""Being a New Yorker, I'd never seen a fundamentalist before, as far as I knew. I was totally fascinated,"" she said. 
She kept tabs on Falwell and his successors over the years, watching as evangelical Christians became a key voting bloc within the Republican Party. Nearly four decades after her church visit in Virginia, she published a 752-page overview of the faith, just in time to dissect evangelical support for President Donald Trump. 
""I became convinced that the only way for people to understand evangelicals is to understand their history,"" FitzGerald said. 
""The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America"" was a finalist for this year's National Book Award in nonfiction, awarded Nov. 15 to Masha Gessen for ""The Future is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia."" FitzGerald previously won a National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for ""Fire in the Lake,"" which explores Vietnamese history and American involvement in the Vietnam War. 
We turned to FitzGerald this week for help understanding some of the biggest religion news stories of the year. This interview was edited for length and clarity. 
Evangelicals are in the news this week for standing by Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore after he was accused of sexual misconduct. Where does that instinct to protect Moore come from? 
It comes from the same place that the instinct to support Donald Trump came from. 
Moore is well-known in his state, and he's upheld what many people think of as Christian values. He's practically gone to jail for them. 
In the past, he put up the Ten Commandments on the wall of his courthouse. He's been known to make all kinds of radical remarks about homosexuality and guns and so forth. 
I think people believe that Roy Moore and they themselves as evangelicals are being persecuted by Yankees and The Washington Post and so on. That they're not being allowed to live as they want to. 
What prompted that sense of persecution? 
I think it goes back to the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy (in the 1920s and 1930s.) Fundamentalists tried to take over the Baptist and Presbyterian churches and failed. They became separatists and began to feel that everyone was against them. The real problem was that nobody paid any attention to them. 
Then, the 1960s and 1970s brought radical changes like feminism. There were a lot of people who felt these shifts were interfering with their way of life, traditional families and so forth. 
But evangelicals have also persecuted other faith groups, and there have been high-profile attacks, for example, on Mormons and Muslims. Does this aggression stem from theological or political concerns? 
I think their political persona derives from theological differences. 
Obviously, the worst thing you can be as far as many evangelicals are concerned is Muslim. But theologically, that's not necessarily true. You could imagine a preacher making the case that Mormons are worse than Muslims theologically. 
But since Muslims are associated with the Middle East and terrorism and understood to be anti-Israel, they become more politically incorrect, if you will. 
As evangelicals face the same membership decline affecting most faith groups today, are they becoming more open to interfaith alliances? 
Absolutely. But I think it only goes so far. 
They can align with the Catholic Church on abortion and contraception, but they run into problems with other social justice issues. It really depends on if you're talking about conservative Catholics or progressive Catholics. 
Why should people who aren't evangelical Christians care about this faith group? 
They represent one-fifth to a quarter of the entire country. They are a large part of the Republican Party, and, to some extent, they run the party. Politically, they're very important. 
When they went for Trump, it made a big difference for the Trump campaign. 
Evangelical support for Trump came as a surprise to many Americans, including leaders within the evangelical Christian community. What happened? 
Nobody expected the vote to go for Trump, including leaders of the Christian right. During the early part of the primaries, 50 of them got together and decided who to vote for and, of course, they chose Ted Cruz, who they thought was the most plausible. After all, he's an evangelical and a Texas conservative. 
But then it turned out that only a minority of evangelicals voted for Cruz, which is fairly unprecedented. The evangelical world is splintering in many ways. 
Many right-wing evangelicals were part of the tea party, for example. And there's also a progressive left wing that didn't exist before 2005. 
And younger evangelicals tend to be more like the progressives. They're social-justice oriented. They haven't given up on (changing) abortion laws, but they tend to support homosexual rights and gay marriage. 
What will the splintering mean for the next election? 
It really depends on who runs. 
The changes are going to be incremental, because they're demographic. Young evangelicals don't vote as much as older people, but, as they grow older, they will. 
The splintering is going to continue. Right-wing evangelicals will join with the secular right, while progressive evangelicals join with people of other faiths and secular people over the issues they care about, like immigration. 
It may be that we won't be talking about an evangelical vote.

78,Marwa Eltagouri - The Washington Post,2017-11-21T20:01:44.000+02:00,"{'persons': [], 'organizations': [], 'locations': []}",[],,,english,0,2017-11-21T16:45:00.000+02:00,,"A Florida church has a warning for visitors: 'This is not a gun free zone'   9:45 AM Marwa Eltagouri - The Washington Post 
Two days after a gunman killed 26 people at a small Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a pastor at a Tampa Bay church took to Instagram. 
Senior Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church posted a photo of the signs on his church doors: ""WE ARE HEAVILY ARMED - ANY ATTEMPT WILL BE DEALT WITH DEADLY FORCE - YES WE ARE A CHURCH AND WE WILL PROTECT OUR PEOPLE."" 
The signs on the 21-year-old nondenominational church are about a year old, but caught national attention on social media after Howard-Browne's post was picked up by media outlets in the weeks after the Sutherland Springs shooting. The post has received both praise and criticism. 
""Very sad that it is necessary to carry and be alert for killers while worshiping. It is our right and our duty to protect self and others - even in church,"" Instagram user dorothea6111 commented. 
""Awesome! Had the same idea for my church,"" another Instagram user, gerswhin75, commented. ""For those that are shocked by this - God will protect His people, but He expects us to do our part. That's why we use seat belts, or wear helmets . . . just like others. We do our part, let God do His."" 
Some state and federal officials have called for greater security measures in places of worship in the weeks after the shooting in Sutherland Springs, where an armed civilian returned fire on the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley. There have been more than a dozen fatal shootings since 2012 at U.S. houses of worship, according to the Associated Press. Faith leaders say churches are particularly vulnerable. 
Many of the 1,200 to 1,300 members of the River at Tampa Bay Church are armed and prepared to use their weapons if necessary, Associate Pastor Allen Hawes told the Tampa Bay Times. Hawes, who has been with the church for 15 years, has a concealed weapons license himself, he told the newspaper. The church also holds concealed weapons permit classes, he said. 
""It is a deterrent,"" he told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Look at what is going on. In the past two months, look at what happened in Texas. Look at what happened in Las Vegas. Because we are a church that is on television, we are very involved in the community. We want people to know that this is a safe zone."" 
Hawes said the church follows local crime closely, including the unsolved homicides of four people in a Tampa neighborhood. 
""I think just collectively, we pay very close attention,"" Hawes told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Look at Seminole Heights. Someone is murdering people. This stuff is happening all the time. Do you wait for another shooting to take precautions?"" 
Other pastors, like Southern Baptist pastor Jack Graham, say it is important for all churches - large and small - to have a security procedure in the event of a shooting. 
""We are living in dangerous days,"" Graham, an evangelical adviser to President Donald Trump, said on Twitter. His Plano, Texas, megachurch, he said earlier this month, is preparing to host church leaders for a security training. 
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, R, told Fox News shortly after the shooting that authorities cannot keep guns away from those intent on breaking the law. Concealed weapons laws, however, can let armed citizens stop a gunman before first responders arrive on a scene. 
""We've had shootings at churches for forever,"" the attorney general, who has advocated concealed-carry laws in the past, told Fox News. ""It's going to happen again, so we need people in churches - either professional security or at least arming some of the parishioners, or the congregation, so they can respond when something like this happens again."" 
But Manny Garcia, the deputy executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, criticized Paxton's comments. 
""Something is woefully wrong when elected officials wring their hands and suggest we can only stay safe by bringing arsenals to church,"" he told the Dallas Morning News. ""Texans deserve more from their chief law enforcement official than inaction and willful ignorance. The answer to horrific gun violence is not more of the same. Lord knows we have already had plenty of that."" 
At the River at Tampa Bay Church, parishioner Julian Sutton told ABC Action News that he supports Howard-Browne and other leaders' security measures. 
""People are in a place that they should feel safe,"" Sutton said. ""To know that we have people that carry, in the event that something were to take place, that something like that could be stopped."" 
Howard-Browne, who came to Florida from South Africa nearly 30 years ago as a missionary, was among a group of evangelical leaders who met with Trump in the Oval Office in July and laid their hands on him as he bowed in prayer. Trump gave the leaders a tour of his private quarters in the White House before he announced an executive order on religious freedom. 
Howard-Browne posted photos of the meeting on Instagram and wrote in a Facebook post that he was asked to pray over Trump. The pastor asked God for ""supernatural wisdom, guidance and protection,"" he wrote. 
""Wow - we are going to see another great spiritual awakening,"" he wrote. 
Howard-Browne could not immediately be reached for comment.

Event Saturday - Anna Sophia Amoruso, owners of the business and the Bossa Girl, revealed that Girlboss is racing events #Girlboss 2017 sold and doubled in 2014, with her books in attendance in March.

When it was announced in December, it seemed like a day-to-day conference on Amor's attitude to election concerns. In his speeches at Instagram, Amorso says: ""When I wrote #Girlboss the next three years ago, I do not know how to do it."" Back in 2016, the world promotes cooperation, co-operation and mutual understanding about the future. ""

Rally is also Amor's number one media company, ""Girlboss Media"". Amoruso's goal is to ""inspire, informative, and fun"" as well as the sisters, sister, and I have been the best people to identify my successes. ""

Is it possible for the Kizilboss Media to succeed in ignoring the tectonic movements of the publicly held elections?
Web and Girl Ioss events (for example, rallies) focus on business, personal finance, health, travel and fashion, he said Amoruso - this plugin #Girlbossu. However, the list is missing. This is not about 2014, but in 2017, and Amrâ € ™ s viewers have changed over the course of three years. Young women went to industry in March. The most important men and women are observed in political and mass media.

However, Gorbachev does not have any significant influence on politics, says Amorso. The company supports 450,000 viewers at Amorphon and Instagram. But can it succeed without reflecting the tectonic movement of the elections held by viewers?

It depends on the equality of men and women: he returns to his career, the city grows stronger, or satisfies the political need, which brings President Trump. . In addition, Amoruso was again forced to compromise the feminist identity, the darkness, the complex, everlasting jungle and everlasting defenses.","{'uuid': '52e48a3bdf2483b9ccdbe07997e438e8d0337543', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7CLhAQu4Y_j_3KH2t7gORU-', 'site_full': 'pastebin.com', 'site': 'pastebin.com', 'site_section': '', 'site_categories': [], 'section_title': '', 'title': 'Google Translate', 'title_full': 'Google Translate', 'published': '2017-11-21T19:59:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 0, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'country': 'CA', 'spam_score': 0.922, 'main_image': '', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 1737, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",Google Translate,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7CLhAQu4Y_j_3KH2t7gORU-,52e48a3bdf2483b9ccdbe07997e438e8d0337543

Congressional Republicans took an important step on Thursday toward the biggest tax-code overhaul since the 1980s.

The House vote shifted the tax debate to the U.S. Senate, where that chamber’s own plan was being debated into Thursday evening. That measure has already encountered resistance from some within the Republicans ranks.

People wish to live in bliss and say ""It is what it is"" and not do anything like sorting out their garbage or using electric cars.
Think about this. We've been searching for a planet now to live on, and we've run into many dead ends. Like an animal, we are meant to live HERE, not anywhere else, and we evolved over time from animals here. Even if we destroyed the global temperature, now, its still better than anywhere else. The Earth is OUR environment.
It has gotten so bad, with everyone around the world. Money is really a messed up thing, and its killing humanity. People are too comfortable and spoiled to change. (I am too and I'm working on getting better.) Personally, I think the best thing would be for us to live in another dimension where we go back in time on Earth and change. We should leave the people that think there is nothing wrong to be on Earth. We want true people of the new age. There's too many people and politics and greed have gotten so bad, we are forced to stay put, just barely moving in bringing a change, because people up in government and big business corps do not want us to do something that would affect THEM. They continue to hurt us.
This is the future of our children and grandchildren if humanity does not progress. Donald Trump is a bad excuse. Think about this. If he gets impeached, Mike Pence becomes President, and there's no hope there either. We have limited time. We should think twice before electing someone anti-climate change. Because of all the propaganda caused by the Koch Brothers and Rupert Murdoch on Republican outlets, its best to look at the Democratic Party in electing someone. The Democratic Party has propaganda but its not as poisonous at all as the right-wing in this situation and they support in having the world change in response of climate change. The Koch Brothers and such, WANT to continue their business. They do not want anybody harming their flow of money, and will be the most evil sobs to do it. They have shown now that they are willing to become a piss stain in humanity's history.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin discussed efforts to bring peace to war-torn Syria during an hour-plus phone call on Tuesday. Iran, North Korea and Ukraine also were on the agenda, the White House said. 
Trump called it a ""great call"" Tuesday afternoon as he left the White House to spend Thanksgiving in Florida. Noting the length, he said he and Putin spoke ""very strongly about bringing peace to Syria"" and ""very strongly about North Korea."" 
Trump's phone call with the Russian president came a day after Putin met with Syrian President Bashar Assad. Putin hosted Assad at a Black Sea resort ahead of a summit later this week with Russia, Turkey and Iran. Assad was called to Russia to get him to agree to potential peace initiatives drafted by the other three countries, the Kremlin said. 
The Kremlin said Putin briefed Trump in the phone call about his talks with Assad and plans for a political settlement in Syria. Putin also called for coordination of anti-terror efforts with the U.S., the Kremlin said, adding that Afghanistan was also discussed. 
Trump and Putin spoke informally several times earlier this month when they attended a summit in Vietnam. They agreed on a number of principles for the future of Syria.

Not Possible! Charlie Rose interiews Putin If one wants to understand why it is so difficult to believe that a highly respected figure in any given community is guilty of sexual misconduct of any kind, I think yesterday’s revelation about Charlie Rose is instructive. I don’t know Mr. Rose. Never met him. But I was a fan. He seemed to me like a man of great honor and integrity in a business where that is sorely lacking. He had an ability to disarm world leaders during sit-down interviews on his PBS television show. At 75 years of age, I don’t know if there was anyone more respected in the television news business than Charlie. I am kind of a news junkie. Which is why I have my morning coffee watching the CBS’s Morning News every morning. I record it since it begins at 7:00 AM while I am in the middle of studying Gemarah (Daf Yomi). I looked forward every day to watching a 20 minute uninterrupted newscast by this respected reporter who along with his 2 female partners co-hosted the show. Charlie seemed like a mentor to them. I wondered how those two female co-hosts would react to the tawdry revelations by his victims about their mentor. This morning I found out. Clearly they had the right approach. They condemned his behavior and applauded his victims for coming forward. But you could see the disbelief and disappointment written all over their faces. It transcended their words. They simply could not believe that their partner and mentor for whom they had in the past expressed so much respect and admiration; a man that had not displayed anything but warmth and professionalism - could have done anything like that. But he did. He admitted it in an apology he made publicly. (How ‘nice’ that he apologized now after being exposed!) This might be one reason why there has been so much resistance by some rabbinic leaders to reporting suspicions of sexual abuse directly to the police. They look at the people that have been suspected of it in their own community that garner similar respect and wonder how it is possible? In many of those cases, those respected individuals have denied it – claiming that allegations of abuse are false and the result of some sort of personal agenda. They just cannot get themselves to believe that an individual that is one of their community icons could ever do what he was accused of doing. One may recall exactly that kind of reaction by the Satmar community to accusations of abuse and rape by Nechemya Weberman of one of his ‘patients’. It might now be a little easier to understand it. They could not – and did not believe this highly respected man who had ‘helped’ so many teens at risk; a man who exuded an exemplary religious lifestyle, a man who was so religious; so Godly that he recited Tehillim throughout his trial in his seat next to his lawyer – hardly paying any attention to the proceedings; a man whose family stood by him and his denials throughout his trial and after… They could not believe such a man was capable of doing what he was accused of. He was the ‘Charlie Rose’ of Satmar. Only instead of admitting it, he denied it. It was pretty easy for the rest of us to see him as guilty. The cold hard facts of sexual abuse came out during his trial. He was found guilty. But to his peers in the world of Satmar? Impossible. They rejected the verdict and blamed it on lies by his accuser and on the antisemitism of the court and the jury. To them Weberman was hero being punished because of what he looked like - A Chasidic Jew. I get it now. After seeing how Charlie Rose’s colleagues reacted to the devastating accusations against him even after he admitted it – I can understand why Weberman’s colleagues in the religious community whose reputation among them was similarly high - reacted to allegations about him when he denied it. Much like the denial about Shlomo Carlebach’s sexual abuse by so many of his fans. A man like that?! Impossible. He too was the ‘Charlie Rose’ of his fan base. Please do no misunderstand. I have not changed my views at all about reporting suspicions of sex abuse directly to the police, no matter how respected the suspected abuser is. That is is a no brainer for me. But at the same time, I understand the resistance to it. What is happening now is something I never in a million years would have believed could happen. I had always believed that sex abuse was the province of sociopaths that could never gain any respect. Their narcissistic personalities would have prevented them from it. How wrong I was! These are all sick people. They are not always purely evil. In some cases there is a lot of good in them too. Otherwise they could never garner any real respect from their community, let alone become icons. Obviously the bad far exceeds the good. Because they carelessly and recklessly disregarded the value of the human life they destroy. By their disgusting behavior they ruin lives. Apologies like those of Charlie Rose that come after they have been exposed are disingenuous and pretty meaningless in my book. I am still in a state of shock about all this. When is it all going to end? It seems like every day, new revalations about sexual misconduct of one type or another comes out about yet another prominent individual - about which one would have never expected it. How many prominent people are there that have yet to be exposed? They must all be shaking in their boots! If you would have asked me just a few weeks ago whether so many icons would be outed so quickly as remotely abusive, I would have answered ‘No possible way!’ And yet here we are. The list is of prominent people so accused (going back to the 70s) is breathtaking. In both their number and station: Bill Clinton, Roman Polanski, Bill Cosby, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Anthony Weiner, Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly, Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein, James Toback, Kevin Spacey, George Bush (41), Elie Weisel, Shlomo Carelebach, Dustin Hoffman, Ben Afflek, Louis CK, Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Moore, Jeremy Piven, Mark Halperin, Al Franken, Charlie Rose… This is just a partial list. There is probably more to come. Will it ever end? Who’s next?

By MATTHEW PENNINGTONAssociated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration readied new sanctions Tuesday on North Korea, a day after declaring it a state sponsor of terrorism in a move to put additional pressure on Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
North Korea has joined Iran, Sudan and Syria on America's terror blacklist, a largely symbolic step as the administration already has the authority to impose virtually any sanctions it wants on Kim Jong Un's government over its nuclear weapons development. 
As part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign, President Donald Trump said the Treasury Department would impose more sanctions on North Korea and ""related persons"" starting Tuesday, without hinting who or what would be targeted. The move is part of rolling effort to deprive Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs and leave it internationally isolated. 
""It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it's finished over a two-week period,"" Trump said. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday the pressure campaign was starting to bite in Pyongyang, which is already facing unprecedented U.N.-mandated sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Tillerson said anecdotal evidence and intelligence suggests the North is now suffering fuel shortages, with queues at gas stations, and its revenues are down. 
The United States has been applying sanctions of its own as well. 
In Tokyo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the move, telling reporters Japan supports the step as a way to increase pressure on North Korea. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang expressed concern. 
Lu said Tuesday that the situation is ""highly sensitive"" and that it would be ""helpful to bring all parties back to the negotiation table instead of doing the opposite."" 
Da Zhigang, a North Korea expert at the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said the move ""will arouse diplomatic reactions and hatred toward the U.S. from North Korea"" and could even prompt the North to resume missile tests. 
An editorial Tuesday in North Korea's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called Trump a ""heinous criminal"" who had insulted the dignity of the country's supreme leadership and its socialist system during his recent visit to South Korea. The editorial, carried by the state-run news agency, threatened ""merciless punishment."" It did not mention the terror designation. 
In September, Trump opened the way for the U.S. to punish foreign companies dealing with North Korea. He issued an executive order expanding the Treasury Department's ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with the North, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system. 
Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow on Northeast Asia at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Treasury could be preparing more designations against North Korean entities related to the terrorism listing, or possibly Chinese or other companies violating the September order. 
A potential target would be Chinese banks that serve as North Korea's conduit to the international system. Such a move would irk Beijing, whose help Trump is counting on to put an economic squeeze on Pyongyang. China recently sent its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years to discuss the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula. 
Tillerson urged China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's external trade, to take unilateral steps to cut fuel supplies to its wayward neighbor. China, which is calling for dialogue to ease the nuclear tensions, is reluctant to exert economic pressure that could destabilize the North. 
Tillerson acknowledged a two-month pause in the North's rapid tempo of nuclear and missile tests and said there was still hope for diplomacy. With tougher sanctions in the offing, he warned Kim, ""This is only going to get worse until you're ready to come and talk."" 
The terror designation, however, is likely to exacerbate sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim. North Korea shows no interest in talks aimed at getting it to give up its nukes. 
North Korea has been on and off the terror list over the years. It was designated for two decades because of its involvement in international terror attacks in the 1980s, then taken off in 2008 to smooth the way for nuclear talks that soon failed.

Polychroniou, truth-out.org   Noam Chomsky and Robert Pollin discuss how the left can save the US from neoliberal excesses. (Image: Jared Rodriguez / Truthout ) 
  
We live in an age of illegitimate neoliberal hegemony and soaring political uncertainty. The evidence is all around: citizen disillusionment over mainstream political parties and the traditional conservative-liberal divide, massive inequality, the rise of the “alt-right,” and growing resistance to Trumpism and financial capitalism. 
Yes, the present age is full of contradictions of every type and variety, and this is something that makes the goals and aims of the left for the reordering of society along the lines of a true democratic polity and in accordance with the vision of a socialist reorganization of the economy more challenging than ever before. 
In this context, the interview below, with Noam Chomsky and Robert Pollin, which appeared originally in Truthout in three separate parts, seeks to provide theoretical and practical guidance to the most pressing social, economic and political issues facing the United States today. It is part of an effort to help the left reimagine an alternative but realistic social order in an age when the old order is dying but the new has yet to be born. 
Noam Chomsky is professor emeritus of linguistics at MIT and laureate professor in the department of linguistics at the University of Arizona. Robert Pollin is distinguished professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. These two thinkers are pathbreakers in the quest to envision a humane and equitable society, and their words can provide a helpful framework as we strive — within an oppressive system and under a repressive government — to fathom new ways of living together in the world. 
C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, the rise of Donald Trump has unleashed a rather unprecedented wave of social resistance in the US. Do you think the conditions are ripe for a mass progressive/socialist movement in this country that can begin to reframe the major policy issues affecting the majority of people, and perhaps even challenge and potentially change the fundamental structures of the US political economy? 
Noam Chomsky: There is indeed a wave of social resistance, more significant than in the recent past — though I’d hesitate about calling it “unprecedented.” Nevertheless, we cannot overlook the fact that in the domain of policy formation and implementation, the right is ascendant, in fact some of its harshest and most destructive elements [are rising]. 
Nor should we overlook a crucial fact that has been evident for some time: The figure in charge, though often ridiculed, has succeeded brilliantly in his goal of occupying media and public attention while mobilizing a very loyal popular base — and one with sinister features, sometimes smacking of totalitarianism, including adoration of The Leader. That goes beyond the core of loyal Trump supporters…. [A majority of Republicans ] favor shutting down or at least fining the press if it presents “biased” or “false news”— terms that mean information rejected by The Leader, so we learn from polls showing that by overwhelming margins, Republicans not only believe Trump far more than the hated mainstream media, but even far more than their own media organ, the extreme right Fox news. And half of Republicans would back postponing the 2020 election if Trump calls for it. 
It is also worth bearing in mind that among a significant part of his worshipful base, Trump is regarded as a “wavering moderate” who cannot be fully trusted to hold fast to the true faith of fierce White Christian identity politics. A recent illustration is the primary victory of the incredible Roy Moore in Alabama despite Trump’s opposition. (“Mr. President, I love you but you are wrong,” as the banners read). The victory of this Bible-thumping fanatic has led senior party strategists to [ conclude ] “that the conservative base now loathes its leaders in Washington the same way it detested President Barack Obama”— referring to leaders who are already so far right that one needs a powerful telescope to locate them at the outer fringe of any tolerable political spectrum. 
The potential power of the ultra-right attack on the far right is [ illustrated ] by the fact that Moore spent about $200,000, in contrast to his Trump-backed opponent, the merely far-right Luther Strange, who received more than $10 million from the national GOP and other far-right sources. The ultra-right is spearheaded by Steve Bannon, one of the most dangerous figures in the shiver-inducing array that has come to the fore in recent years. It has the huge financial support of the Mercer family, along with ample media outreach through Breitbart news, talk radio and the rest of the toxic bubble in which loyalists trap themselves. While Trump keeps the spotlight on himself, the “respectable” Republican establishment chips away at government programs that benefit the general population. 
In the most powerful state in history, the current Republican Party is ominous enough. What is not far on the horizon is even more menacing. 
Much has been said about how Trump has pulled the cork out of the bottle and legitimized neo-Nazism, rabid white supremacy, misogyny and other pathologies that had been festering beneath the surface. But it goes much beyond even that. 
I do not want to suggest that adoration of the Dear Leader is something new in American politics, or confined to the vulgar masses. The veneration of Reagan that has been diligently fostered has some of the same character, in intellectual circles as well. Thus, in publications of the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, we learn that Reagan’s “spirit seems to stride the country, watching us like a warm and friendly ghost.” Lucky us, protected from harm by a demi-god. 
Whether by design, or simply inertia, the Republican wrecking ball has been following a two-level strategy. Trump keeps the spotlight on himself with one act after another, assuming (correctly) that yesterday’s antics will be swept aside by today’s. And at the same time, often beneath the radar, the “respectable” Republican establishment chips away at government programs that might be of benefit to the general population, but not to their constituency of extreme wealth and corporate power. They are systematically pursuing what Financial Times economic correspondent Martin Wolf calls “pluto-populism,” a doctrine that imposes “policies that benefit plutocrats, justified by populist rhetoric.” An amalgam that has registered unpleasant successes in the past as well. 
Meanwhile, the Democrats and centrist media help out by focusing their energy and attention on whether someone in the Trump team talked to Russians, or [whether] the Russians tried to influence our “pristine” elections — though at most in a way that is undetectable in comparison with the impact of campaign funding, let alone other inducements that are the prerogative of extreme wealth and corporate power and are hardly without impact. 
The Russian saboteurs of democracy seem to be everywhere. There was great anxiety about Russian intervention in the recent German elections, perhaps contributing to the frightening surge of support for the right-wing nationalist, if not neo-fascist, “Alternative for Germany” [AfD]. AfD did indeed have outside help, it turns out, but not from the insidious Putin. “The Russian meddling that German state security had been anticipating apparently never materialized,” according to Bloomberg News . “Instead, the foreign influence came from America.” More specifically, from Harris Media, whose clients include Marine Le Pen’s National Front in France, Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, and our own Donald Trump. With the valuable assistance of the Berlin office of Facebook, which created a population model and provided the needed data, Harris’s experts micro-targeted Germans in categories deemed susceptible to AfD’s message — with some success, it appears. The firm is now planning to move on to coming European races, it has announced. 
Nevertheless, all is not bleak by any means. The most spectacular feature of the 2016 elections was not the election of a billionaire who spent almost as much as his lavishly-funded opponent and enjoyed fervent media backing. Far more striking was the remarkable success of the Sanders campaign, breaking with over a century of mostly bought elections. The campaign relied on small contributions and had no media support, to put it mildly. Though lacking any of the trappings that yield electoral success in our semi-plutocracy, Sanders probably would have won the Democratic Party nomination, perhaps the presidency, if it hadn’t been for the machinations of party managers. His popularity undimmed, he is now a leading voice for progressive measures and is amassing considerable support for his moderate social democratic proposals, reminiscent of the New Deal — proposals that would not have surprised President Eisenhower, but are considered practically revolutionary today as both parties have shifted well to the right [with] Republicans virtually off the spectrum of normal parliamentary politics. 
Offshoots of the Sanders campaign are doing valuable work on many issues, including electoral politics at the local and state level, which had been pretty much abandoned to the Republican right, particularly during the Obama years, to very harmful effect. There is also extensive and effective mobilization against racist and white supremacist pathologies, often spearheaded by the dynamic Black Lives Matter movement. Defying Trumpian and general Republican denialism, a powerful popular environmental movement is working hard to address the existential crisis of global warming. These, along with significant efforts on other fronts, face very difficult barriers, which can and must be overcome. 
Bob, it is clear by now that Trump has no plan for creating new jobs, and even his reckless stance toward the environment will have no effect on the creation of new jobs. What would a progressive policy for job creation look like that will also take into account concerns about the environment and climate change? 
Robert Pollin: A centerpiece for any kind of progressive social and economic program needs to be full employment with decent wages and working conditions. The reasons are straightforward, starting with money. Does someone in your family have a job and, if so, how much does it pay? For the overwhelming majority of the world’s population, how one answers these two questions determines, more than anything else, what one’s living standard will be. But beyond just money, your job is also crucial for establishing your sense of security and self-worth, your health and safety, your ability to raise a family, and your chances to participate in the life of your community. Building a green economy in the US generates roughly three times more jobs per dollar than maintaining our fossil fuel dependency. 
How do we get to full employment, and how do we stay there? For any economy, there are two basic factors determining how many jobs are available at any given time. The first is the overall level of activity — with GDP as a rough, if inadequate measure of overall activity — and the second is what share of GDP goes to hiring people into jobs. In terms of our current situation, after the Great Recession hit in full in 2008, US GDP has grown at an anemic average rate of 1.3 percent per year, as opposed to the historic average rate from 1950 until 2007 of 3.3 percent. If the economy had grown over the past decade at something even approaching the historic average rate, the economy would have produced more than enough jobs to employ all 13 million people who are currently either unemployed or underemployed by the official government statistics, plus the nearly 9 million people who have dropped out of the labor force since 2007. 
In terms of focusing on activities where job creation is strong, let’s consider two important sets of economic sectors. First, spending $1 million on education will generate a total of about 26 jobs within the US economy, more than double the 11 jobs that would be created by spending the same $1 million on the US military. Similarly, spending $1 million on investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency will create over 16 jobs within the US, while spending the same $1 million on our existing fossil fuel infrastructure will generate about 5.3 jobs — i.e. building a green economy in the US generates roughly three times more jobs per dollar than maintaining our fossil fuel dependency. So full employment policies should focus on accelerating economic growth and on changing our priorities for growth — as two critical examples, to expand educational opportunities across the board and to build a green economy, while contracting both the military and the fossil fuel economy. 
A full employment program also obviously needs to focus on the conditions of work, starting with wages. The most straightforward measure of what neoliberal capitalism has meant for the US working class is that the average wage for non-supervisory workers in 2016 was about 4 percent lower than in 1973 . This is while average labor productivity — the amount each worker produces over the course of a year — has more than doubled over this same 43-year period. All of the gains from productivity doubling under neoliberalism have therefore been pocketed by either supervisory workers, or even more so, by business owners and corporate shareholders seeing their profits rise. The only solution here is to fight to increase worker bargaining power. We need stronger unions and worker protections, including a $15 federal minimum wage. Such initiatives need to be combined with policies to expand the overall number of job opportunities out there. A fundamental premise of neoliberalism from day one has been to dismantle labor protections. We are seeing an especially aggressive variant of this approach today under the so-called “centrist” policies of the new French President Emmanuel Macron. 
What about climate change and jobs? A view that has long been touted, most vociferously by Trump over the last two years, is that policies to protect the environment and to fight climate change are bad for jobs and therefore need to be junked. But this claim is simply false. In fact, as the evidence I have cited above shows, building a green economy is good for jobs overall, much better than maintaining our existing fossil-fuel based energy infrastructure, which also happens to be the single most significant force driving the planet toward ecological disaster. 
It is true that building a green economy will not be good for everyone’s jobs. Notably, people working in the fossil fuel industry will face major job losses. The communities in which these jobs are concentrated will also face significant losses. But the solution here is straightforward: Just Transition policies for the workers, families and communities who will be hurt as the coal, oil and natural gas industries necessarily contract to zero over roughly the next 30 years. Working with Jeannette Wicks-Lim, Heidi Garrett-Peltier and Brian Callaci at [the Political Economy Research Institute], and in conjunction with labor, environmental and community groups in both the states of New York and Washington, we have developed what I think are quite reasonable and workable Just Transition programs. They include solid pension protections, re-employment guarantees, as well as retraining and relocation support for individual workers, and community-support initiatives for impacted communities. 
The single most important factor that makes all such initiatives workable is that the total number of affected workers is relatively small. For example, in the whole United States today, there are a total of about 65,000 people employed directly in the coal industry. This represents less than 0.05 percent of the 147 million people employed in the US. Considered within the context of the overall US economy, it would only require a minimum level of commitment to provide a just transition to these workers as well as their families and communities. 
Finally, I think it is important to address one of the major positions on climate stabilization that has been advanced in recent years on the left, which is to oppose economic growth altogether, or to support “de-growth.” The concerns of de-growth proponents — that economic growth under neoliberal capitalism is both grossly unjust and ecologically unsustainable — are real. But de-growth is not a viable solution. Consider a very simple example — that under a de-growth program, global GDP contracts by 10 percent. This level of GDP contraction would be five times larger than what occurred at the lowest point of the 2007-09 Great Recession, when the unemployment rate more than doubled in the United States. But even still, this 10 percent contraction in global GDP would have the effect, on its own, of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by precisely 10 percent. At a minimum, we would still need to cut emissions by another 30 percent within 15 years, and another 80 percent within 30 years to have even a fighting chance of stabilizing the climate. As such, the only viable climate stabilization program is to invest massively in clean renewable and high energy efficiency systems so that clean energy completely supplants our existing fossil-fuel dependent system within the next 30 years, and to enact comparable transformations in agricultural production processes. 
The “masters of the universe” have made a huge comeback since the last financial crisis, and while Trump’s big-capital-friendly policies are going to make the rich get richer, they could also spark the next financial crisis. So, Bob, what type of progressive policies can and should be enforced to contain the destructive tendencies of finance capital? 
Pollin: The classic book Manias, Panics, and Crashes by the late MIT economist Charles Kindleberger makes clear that, throughout the history of capitalism, unregulated financial markets have persistently produced instability and crises. The only deviation from this long-term pattern occurred in the first 30 years after World War II, roughly from 1946-1975. The reason US and global financial markets were much more stable over this 30-year period is that the markets were heavily regulated then, through the Glass-Steagall regulatory system in the US, and the Bretton Woods system globally. These regulatory systems were enacted only in response to the disastrous Great Depression of the 1930s, which began with the 1929 Wall Street crash and which then brought global capitalism to its knees. 
Of course, the big Wall Street players always hated being regulated and fought persistently, first to evade the regulations and then to dismantle them. They were largely successful through the 1980s and 1990s. But the full, official demise of the 1930s regulatory system came only in 1999, under the Democratic President Bill Clinton. At the time, virtually all leading mainstream economists — including liberals, such as Larry Summers, who was Treasury Secretary when Glass-Steagall was repealed — argued that financial regulations were an unnecessary vestige of the bygone 1930s. All kinds of fancy papers were written “demonstrating” that the big players on Wall Street are very smart people who know what’s best for themselves and everyone else — and therefore, didn’t need government regulators telling them what they could or could not do. It then took less than eight years for hyper-speculation on Wall Street to once again bring global capitalism to its knees. The only thing that saved capitalism in 2008-09 from a repeat of the 1930s Great Depression was the unprecedented government interventions to prop up the system, and the equally massive bail out of Wall Street. An effective regulatory system today would be one guided by a few basic premises that can be applied flexibly but also universally. 
By 2010, the US Congress and President Obama enacted a new set of financial regulations, the Dodd-Frank system. Overall, Dodd-Frank amount to a fairly weak set of measures aiming to dampen hyper-speculation on Wall Street. A large part of the problem is that Dodd-Frank included many opportunities for Wall Street players to delay enactment of laws they didn’t like and for clever lawyers to figure out ways to evade the ones on the books. That said, the Trump administration, led on economic policy matters by two former Goldman Sachs executives, is committed to dismantling Dodd-Frank altogether, and allowing Wall Street to once again operate free of any significant regulatory constraints. I have little doubt that, free of regulations, the already ongoing trend of rising speculation — with, for example, the stock market already at a historic high — will once again accelerate. 
What is needed to build something like a financial system that is both stable and supports a full-employment, ecologically sustainable growth framework? A major problem over time with the old Glass-Steagall system was that there were large differences in the degree to which, for example, commercial banks, investment banks, stock brokerages, insurance companies and mortgage lenders were regulated, thereby inviting clever financial engineers to invent ways to exploit these differences. An effective regulatory system today should therefore be guided by a few basic premises that can be applied flexibly but also universally. The regulations need to apply across the board, regardless of whether you call your business a bank, an insurance company, a hedge fund, a private equity fund, a vulture fund, or some other term that most of us haven’t yet heard about. 
One measure for promoting both stability and fairness across financial market segments is a small sales tax on all financial transactions — what has come to be known as a Robin Hood Tax. This tax would raise the costs of short-term speculative trading and therefore discourage speculation. At the same time, the tax will not discourage “patient” investors who intend to hold their assets for longer time periods, since, unlike the speculators, they will be trading infrequently. A bill called the Inclusive Prosperity Act was first introduced into the House of Representatives by Rep. Keith Ellison in 2012 and then in the Senate by Bernie Sanders in 2015, [and] is exactly the type of measure that is needed here. 
Another important initiative would be to implement what are called asset-based reserve requirements. These are regulations that require financial institutions to maintain a supply of cash as a reserve fund in proportion to the other, riskier assets they hold in their portfolios. Such requirements can serve both to discourage financial market investors from holding an excessive amount of risky assets, and as a cash cushion for the investors to draw upon when market downturns occur. 
This policy instrument can also be used to push financial institutions to channel credit to projects that advance social welfare, for example, promoting investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The policy could stipulate that, say, at least 5 percent of banks’ loan portfolios should be channeled to into clean-energy investments. If the banks fail to reach this 5 percent quota of loans for clean energy, they would then be required to hold this same amount of their total assets in cash. 
Finally, both in the US and throughout the world, there needs to be a growing presence of public development banks. These banks would make loans based on social welfare criteria — including advancing a full-employment, climate-stabilization agenda — as opposed to scouring the globe for the largest profit opportunities regardless of social costs…. Public development banks have always played a central role in supporting the successful economic development paths in the East Asian economies. 
Noam, racism, inequality, mass incarceration and gun violence are pathologies that run deep inside American society. How would a progressive government begin to address these problems if it found itself in a position of power in, say, the next decade or so? 
Chomsky: Very serious problems, no doubt. In order to address them effectively, it’s first necessary to understand them; not a simple matter. Let’s take the four pathologies in turn. 
Racism certainly runs deep. There is no need to elaborate. It’s right before our eyes in innumerable ways, some with considerable historical resonance. Current anti-immigrant hysteria can hardly fail to recall the racist immigration laws that at first barred [Asians] and were extended in the 1920s to Italians and Jews (under a different guise) — incidentally, helping to send many Jews to gas chambers, and after the war, keeping miserable survivors of the Holocaust from US shores. 
Of course, the most extreme case for the past 400 years is the bitter history of African Americans. Current circumstances are shameful enough, commonly held doctrines scarcely less so. The hatred of Obama and anything he touched surely reflects deep-rooted racism. Comparative studies by George Frederickson show that doctrines of white supremacy in the US have been even more rampant than in Apartheid South Africa. 
The Nazis, when seeking precedents for the Nuremberg laws, turned to the United States, taking its anti-miscegenation laws as a model, though not entirely: [Certain] US laws were too harsh for the Nazis because of the “one drop of blood” doctrine. It was not until 1967, under the impact of the civil rights movement, that these abominations were struck down by the Supreme Court. 
And it goes far back, taking many strange forms, including the weird Anglo-Saxon cult that has been prominent for centuries. Benjamin Franklin, the great American figure of the Enlightenment, pondered whether Germans and Swedes should be barred from the country because they are “too swarthy.” Adopting familiar understanding, he observed that “the Saxons only [are] excepted” from this racial “defect”— and by some mysterious process, those who make it to the United States may become Anglo-Saxons, like those already accepted within the canon. 
The national poet Walt Whitman, honored for his democratic spirit, justified the conquest of half of Mexico by asking , “What has miserable, inefficient Mexico … to do with the great mission of peopling the New World with a noble race? Be it ours, to achieve that mission!”— a mission accomplished by the most “wicked war” in history, in the judgment of General-President U.S. Grant, who later regretted his service in it as a junior officer. 
Coming to recent years, Henry Stimson, one of the most distinguished members of the FDR-Truman cabinets (and one of the few to oppose atomic bombing) “consistently maintained that Anglo-Saxons were superior to the ‘lesser breeds’,” historian Sean Langdon Malloy observes in his book, Atomic Tragedy: Henry L. Stimson and the Decision to Use the Bomb – and again reflecting not-uncommon views, asked to have one of his aides reassigned “on the slight possibility that he might be a Hebrew,” in his own words. 
The other three maladies that you mention are also striking features of US society — in some ways, even distinguishing features. But unlike racism, in all three cases, it is partially a contemporary phenomenon. 
Take inequality. Through much of its history, the US did not have high inequality as compared with Europe. Less so, in fact. That began to change in the industrial age, reaching a peak in 1928, after the forceful destruction of the labor movement and crushing of independent thought. Largely as a result of labor mobilization, inequality declined during the Great Depression, a tendency continuing through the great growth period of regulated capitalism in the early postwar decades. The neoliberal era that followed reversed these trends, leading to extreme inequality that may even surpass the 1928 peak. 
Mass incarceration is also period-specific; in fact, the same period. It had reached high levels in the South in the post-reconstruction years after an 1877 North-South compact gave the South free rein to institute “slavery by another name,” as Douglas Blackmon calls the crime in his study of how the former slave-owning states devised techniques to incarcerate much of the Black population. By doing so, they created a renewed slave labor force for the industrial revolution of those years, this time with the state, rather than private capital, responsible for maintaining the slave labor force — a considerable benefit to the ownership class. Turning to more recent times, 30 years ago, US incarceration rates were within the range of developed societies, a little towards the high end. By now they are 5 to 10 times as high, far beyond those of any country with credible statistics. Again, a phenomenon of the past three decades. 
The gun cult is also not as deeply rooted as often supposed. Guns were, of course, needed to conduct the two greatest crimes of American history: controlling slaves and exterminating [Native Americans]. But the general public had little interest in weapons, a matter of much concern to the arms industry. The popular gun cult was cultivated by gun manufacturers in the 19th century in order to create a market beyond governments. Normal capitalism. Methods included concoction of “Wild West” mythology that later became iconic. Such efforts continue, vigorously, until the present. By now, in large sectors of the society, swaggering into a coffee shop with a gun shows that you are really somebody, maybe a Wyatt Earp clone. The outcomes are sobering. Gun homicides in the US are far beyond comparable countries. In Germany, for example, deaths from gun homicide are at the level of deaths in the US from “contact with a thrown or falling object.” And even these shocking figures are misleading. Half of suicides in the US are with firearms, more than 20,000 a year , amounting to two-thirds of all firearm deaths. 
Turning to your question about the four “pathologies”— the four horsemen, one is tempted to say — the questions virtually answer themselves with a careful look at the history, particularly the history since World War II. There have been two phases during the postwar period: regulated capitalism through the ’50s and ’60s, followed by the neoliberal period from the late ’70s, sharply accelerating with Reagan and his successors. It is the latter period when the last three of four pathologies drove the US off the charts. 
During the first postwar phase, there were some significant steps to counter endemic racism and its devastating impact on the victims. That was the great achievement of the mass civil rights movement, peaking in the mid-1960s, though with a very mixed record since. The achievements also had a major impact on the political system. The Democratic Party had been an uneasy coalition, including Southern Democrats, dedicated to racist policies and extremely influential because of seniority in one-party states. That’s why New Deal measures [were] largely restricted to whites; for example, household and agricultural workers were barred from Social Security. 
The alliance fell apart in the ’60s with the fierce backlash against extending minimal rights of citizenship to African-Americans. The South shifted to Republican ranks, encouraged by Nixon’s overtly racist “Southern strategy.” The period since has hardly been encouraging for African Americans, apart from elite sectors. 
Government policies could go some way towards ameliorating these social pathologies, but a great deal more is needed. Such needs can only be fulfilled by dedicated mass popular activism and educational/organizational efforts. These can be facilitated by a more progressive government, but, just as in the case of the civil rights movement, that can be only a help, often a reluctant one. 
On inequality, it was low (by comparative standards) during the period of regulated capitalism — the final era of “great compression” of income as it is sometimes called. Inequality began to increase rapidly with the advent of the neoliberal era, not only in the US, though the US is extreme among developed societies. During the tepid recovery from the Great Recession of 2008, virtually all gains went to the top few percent, mostly 1 percent or a fraction thereof. “For the United States overall, the top 1 percent captured 85.1 percent of total income growth between 2009 and 2013,” an Economic Policy Institute Study revealed . “In 2013 the top 1 percent of families nationally made 25.3 times as much as the bottom 99 percent.” And so, it continues. The latest Federal Reserve studies show that “The share of income received by the top 1 percent of families rose to 23.8 percent in 2016, up from 20.3 percent in 2013. The share of the bottom 90 percent of the distribution fell to 49.7 percent, the lowest on record in the survey’s history.” Other figures are grotesque . Thus, “Average wealth holdings for white families in 2016 were about $933,700, compared with $191,200 for Hispanic families and $138,200 for black families,” a product of deep-rooted racism exacerbating the neoliberal assault. 
The gun culture, too, has expanded rapidly in recent decades. In 1975, the NRA formed a new lobbying arm — a few years later, a PAC — to channel funds to legislators. It soon became one of the most powerful interest-group lobbies , with often fervent popular participation. In 2008, the Supreme Court, in an intellectual triumph of “originalism,” reversed the traditional interpretation of the Second Amendment, which had previously respected its explicit condition on the right to bear arms: the need for “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State….” That provision was understandable in 1790. There was almost no standing army. The world’s most powerful state was still an enemy. The slave population had to be controlled. And the invasion of the rest of what became the national territory was about to be unleashed. Not exactly today’s circumstances. 
Since 2008, our “constitutional right to bear arms,” as declared by the right-wing Roberts Court, has become Holy Writ. 
There are many contributing factors to the sharp break between the two postwar periods — neither [of] which began to approach what is surely possible in the richest society in world history, with incomparable advantages. 
One leading factor is the financialization of the economy, creating a huge bloc of largely predatory institutions devoted to financial manipulations rather than to the real economy — a process by which “Wall Street destroyed Main Street,” in the words of Financial Times editor Rana Foroohar. One of her many illustrations is the world’s leading corporation, Apple. It has astronomical wealth, but to become even richer, has been shifting from devising more advanced marketable goods to finance. Its R&D as a percentage of sales has been falling since 2001, tendencies that extend widely among major corporations. In parallel, capital from financial institutions that financed business investments during the postwar growth period now largely “stays inside the financial system,” Foroohar reports , “enriching financiers, corporate titans, and the wealthiest fraction of the population, which hold the vast majority of financial assets.” 
During the period of rapid growth of financial institutions since the ’70s, there seem to have been few studies of their impact on the economy. Apparently, it was simply taken for granted that since it (sort of) accords with neoliberal market principles, it must be a Good Thing. 
The failure of the profession to study these matters was noted by Nobel laureate in economics Robert Solow after the 2008 crash. His tentative judgment was that the general impact is probably negative: “the successes probably add little or nothing to the efficiency of the real economy, while the disasters transfer wealth from taxpayers to financiers.” By now, there is substantially more evidence. A 2015 paper by two prominent economists found that productivity declines in markets with rapidly expanding financial sectors, impacting mostly the sector most critical for long-term growth and better jobs: advanced manufacturing. One reason, Foroohar observes, is that “finance would rather invest in areas like real estate and construction, which are far less productive but offer quicker, more reliable short-term gains” (hence also bigger bonuses for top management); the Trump-style economy, palatial hotels and golf courses (along with massive debt and repeated bankruptcies). 
In part for related reasons, though productivity has doubled since the late ’70s when finance was beginning to take over the economy, wages have stalled — for male workers, declined. In 2007, before the crash, at the height of euphoria about the grand triumphs of neoliberalism, neoclassical economics and “the Great Moderation,” real wages of American workers were lower than they had been in 1979, when the neoliberal experiment was just taking off. Another factor contributing to this outcome was explained to Congress in 1997 by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, when testifying on the healthy economy he was managing. In his own words, “Atypical restraint on compensation increases has been evident for a few years now and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater worker insecurity.” Insecurity that was, as he noted, markedly increasing even as employment prospects improved. In short, with labor repressed and unions dismantled, workers were too intimidated to seek decent wages and benefits, a sure sign of the health of the economy. 
The same happened to the minimum wage, which sets a floor for others; if it had continued to track productivity, it would now be close to $20 an hour. Crises have rapidly increased as deregulation took off, in accord with the “religion” that markets know best, deplored by another Nobel laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, in a World Bank publication 20 years ago, to no effect. Each crisis is worse than the last; each following recovery weaker than the last. None of this, incidentally, would have come as a surprise to Marxist economists, who pretty much disappeared from the scene in the United States. 
Despite much lofty rhetoric about “free markets,” like other major industries (energy, agribusiness, etc.), financial institutions benefit enormously from government subsidy and other interventions. An IMF study found that the profits of the major banks derive substantially from the implicit government insurance policy (“too big to fail”), which confers advantages far beyond the periodic bailouts when corrupt practices lead to a crash — something that did not happen during the earlier period, before bipartisan neoliberal doctrine fostered deregulation. Other benefits are real but immeasurable, like the incentive to undertake risky (hence profitable) transactions, with the understanding that if they crash, the hardy taxpayer will step in to repair the damage, probably leaving the institutions richer than before, as after the 2008 crash for which they were largely responsible. 
Other factors include the accelerated attack on unions and the radical reduction in taxes for the wealthy, both natural concomitants of neoliberal ideology. Another is the particular form of neoliberal globalization, particularly since the ’90s, designed in ways that offer very high protection and other advantages to corporations, investors and privileged professionals, while setting working people in competition with one another worldwide, with obvious consequences. 
Such measures have a mutually reinforcing effect. As wealth becomes more concentrated, so, automatically, does political power, which leads to government policies that carry the cycle forward. 
A primary goal of the neoliberal reaction was to reverse the falling rate of profit that resulted, in part, from growing labor militancy. That goal has been achieved with impressive success. The professed goals, of course, were quite different. And as always, the reaction was buttressed by ideology. One staple has been the famous thesis of Simon Kuznets: that while inequality increases in early economic development, it begins to decrease as the economy reaches a more advanced level. It follows, then, that there is no need for redistributive policies that interfere with the magic of the market. The Kuznets thesis soon became conventional wisdom among economists and planners. 
There are a few problems, however. One, as [American University economics professor] Jon Wisman observes , is that it wasn’t a thesis, but rather a conjecture, very cautiously advanced. As Kuznets explained, the conjecture was based on “perhaps 5 percent empirical information and 95 percent speculation, some of it possibly tainted by wishful thinking.” This slight qualification in the article was overlooked in a manner not uncommon when there is doctrinal utility in so doing. Other justifications fare similarly. 
One might almost define “neoliberalism”— a bit cruelly, but not entirely unfairly — as an ideology devoted to establishing more firmly a society based on the principle of “private affluence, public squalor”— John Kenneth Galbraith’s condemnation of what he observed in 1958. Much worse was to come with the unleashing of natural tendencies of capitalism in the neoliberal years, now enhanced as its more [brutal] variants are given virtually free rein under Trump-Ryan-McConnell Republicanism. 
All of this is under human control, and can be reversed. There are many realistic options, even without looking beyond short-term feasibility. A small financial transaction tax would sharply reduce the rapid trading that is a net loss to the society while benefiting a privileged few, and would also provide a progressive government with revenue for constructive purposes. It’s common knowledge that the deterioration of infrastructure has reached grotesque proportions. Government programs can begin to address these serious problems. They can also be devoted to improving rather than undermining the deteriorating public education system. Living wage and green economy programs of the kind that Bob Pollin has developed could go a long way toward reducing inequality, and beyond that, creating a much more decent society. Another major contribution would be [an equitable] health care system. In fact, just eliminating the exorbitant patent protections that are a core part of the neoliberal “free trade agreements” would be a huge boon to the general economy — and the arguments for these highly protectionist measures are very weak, as economist Dean Baker has shown convincingly. Legislation to put an end to the “right to scrounge laws” (in Orwellian terminology, “right to work laws”) that are designed to destroy unions could help revive the labor movement, by now with different constituencies, including service and part-time workers. That could reverse the growth of the new “precariat,” another matter of fundamental importance. And it could restore the labor movement to its historic role as the leading force in the struggle for basic human rights. 
There are other paths toward reviving a vital and progressive labor movement. The expansion of worker-owned and managed enterprises, now underway in many places, is a promising development, and need not be limited to a small scale. A few years ago, after the crash, Obama virtually nationalized a large part of the auto industry, then returning it to private ownership. Another possibility would have been to turn the industry over to the workforce, or to stakeholders more broadly (workers and community), who might, furthermore, have chosen to redirect its production to what the country sorely needs: efficient public transportation. That could have happened had there been mass popular support and a receptive government. Recent work by Gar Alperovitz and David Ellerman approaches these matters in highly informative ways. Conversion of military industry along similar lines is also quite conceivable — matters discussed years ago by Seymour Melman. [There are all] options under progressive initiatives. 
The “right to work” legislation that is a darling of the far right will probably soon be established solidly by the Roberts Court now that Neil Gorsuch is in place, thanks to some of Mitch McConnell’s more sordid chicanery in barring Obama’s nominee. The legislation has an interesting pedigree. It traces back to the Southern Christian American Association, an extreme racist and anti-Semitic organization that was bitterly opposed to unions, which its leaders condemned as a devilish contrivance in which “white women and white men will be forced into organizations with black African apes.” Another enemy was “Jewish Marxism,” the “Talmudists” who were planning to Sovietize the world and were already doing so in the US through the “Jew Deal,” known elsewhere as the “New Deal.” 
An immediate objective of moderately progressive policy should be to sharply cut the huge military budget, well over half of discretionary spending and now expanding under the Republican project of dismantling government, apart from service to their wealthy/corporate constituency. One of many good reasons to trim the military budget is that it is extremely dangerous to our own security. A striking illustration is the Obama-Trump nuclear weapons modernization program, which has sharply increased “killing power,” a very important study in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists reported last March. Thereby, the program “creates exactly what one would expect to see, if a nuclear-armed state were planning to have the capacity to fight and win a nuclear war by disarming enemies with a surprise first strike.” These developments, surely known to Russian planners, significantly increase the likelihood that they might resort to a preemptive strike — which means the end — in case of false alarms or very tense moments, of which there are all too many. And here, too, the funds released could be devoted to badly needed objectives, like quickly weaning ourselves from the curse of fossil fuels. 
This is a bare sample. There’s a long list. 
The United States spends more money on health care than any other nation in the world, yet its health care system is highly inefficient and leaves out millions from even basic coverage. What would a socialized health care system look like in the US, and how can the opposition from the private insurance sector, big pharma and the medical industries in general be overcome? 
Chomsky: The facts are startling. It’s an international scandal, and not unknown. A recent study by the US-based Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan health policy research group, found that once again, as repeatedly in the past, the US health care system is the most expensive in the world, far higher than comparable countries, and that it ranks last in performance among these countries. To have combined these two results is a real triumph of the market. The roots of the achievement are not obscure. The US is alone in relying on largely unregulated private insurance companies. Their commitment is to profit, not health, and they produce huge waste in administrative costs, advertising, profit and executive compensation. The government-run component of the health system (Medicare) is far more efficient, but suffers from the need to work through the private institutions. The US is also alone in legislation barring the government from negotiating drug prices, which, not surprisingly, are far above comparable countries. 
These policies do not reflect popular will. Poll results vary, depending on how questions are formulated, but over time, they show considerable, often majority support for a public health system of the kind found elsewhere. Usually, Canada is the model because so little is known about the rest of the world, though it is not ranked as the best. That prize has regularly been won by the British National Health Service, though it, too, is reeling under the neoliberal assault. When Obama’s [Affordable Care Act] was introduced, it included a public option, supported by almost two-thirds of the population. It was unceremoniously deleted. Popular opinion is particularly striking in that [it] receives so little mainstream support, even articulation; and if even brought up, is usually condemned. The main argument against the far more successful systems elsewhere is that adopting their framework would raise taxes. [However, single-payer usually results in] cutting expenses considerably more and benefitting the large majority — so the experience of other countries indicates, [as does] US Medicare. 
The tide may be turning finally. Sanders has received considerable support, even within the political system, for his call for universal health care to be achieved step-by-step in his plan, by gradual extension of Medicare and other means. The temporary collapse of the fanatic seven-year Republican campaign to destroy “Obamacare” may provide openings as well — temporary collapse, because the extremist organization in power has means to undermine health care and are likely to use it in their passionate dedication to destroying anything connected to the reviled Black president …. Nevertheless, there are new openings for some degree of [reason], which could greatly enhance people’s welfare, as well as improving the general economy. 
To be sure, there will be massive opposition from private power, which has extraordinary influence in our limited class-based democracy. But it can be overcome. The historical record shows that economic-political elites respond to militant popular action — and the threat of more — by endorsing ameliorative measures that leave their basic dominance of the society in place. New Deal measures of social reform are one of many illustrations. 
Bob, you produced recently an economic analysis for the backing of a single-payer bill in California (SB-562) and worked on Bernie Sanders’s proposal for universal health care, so what are your own views on the previous question? 
Pollin: A socialized health care system for the US — whether we call it “single-payer,”“Medicare-for-All” or something else — should include two basic features. The first is that every resident … should be guaranteed access to decent health care. The second is that the system achieves significant overall savings relative to our existing system through lowering administrative costs, controlling the prices of prescription drugs and fees for physicians and hospitals, reducing unnecessary treatments and expanding preventive care. 
In our study analyzing the California single-payer proposal, we estimated that providing decent coverage for all state residents — including, in particular, the roughly 40-45 percent of the state’s population who are presently either uninsured or who have inadequate coverage — would increase total costs by about 10 percent under the existing system. But we also estimated that operating the single-payer system could achieve overall savings in the range of 18 percent relative to the existing system in the areas of administration, drug prices, fees for providers and cutting back on wasteful service delivery. Overall then, we found that total health care spending in California would fall by about 8 percent, even with the single-payer system delivering decent care for everyone. My work on the Sanders’s Medicare for All bill is ongoing as of now, so I will hold off on providing estimates of its overall impact. 
Let’s consider how transformative the California-type outcomes would be. Under single-payer in California, decent health care would be established as a basic human right, as it already is in almost all other advanced countries. Nobody would have to forego receiving needed treatments because they didn’t have insurance or they couldn’t afford high insurance premiums and copays. Nobody would have to fear a financial disaster because they faced a health care crisis in their family. Virtually all families would end up financially better off and most businesses would also experience cost savings under single-payer relative to what they pay now to cover their employees. 
How can the opposition from the private health insurance sector, big pharma and the medical industries in general be overcome? It obviously will not be easy. Health care in the US is a $3 trillion business. Profits of the private companies are in the hundreds of billions, even while most of the funding for our existing health care system comes from the federal, state and local government budgets. As one example of how to respond to this political reality, we can learn from the work of the California Nurses Association/National Nurses United. The nurses’ union has been fighting for single-payer for over 20 years. They bring enormous credibility to the issue, because their members see firsthand how the health and financial well-being of especially non-wealthy people in the US suffer under our current system. 
There is no secret as to how the nurses’ union fights on behalf of single-payer. They believe in their cause and are highly effective in the ways they organize and advance their position. The basics are as simple as that. 
Noam, higher education in the US is a terribly expensive affair, and hundreds of billions are owed in student loans. First, do you think that a system of free higher education can coexist alongside tuition-charging universities? Secondly, what could and should be done about student debt? 
Chomsky: The educational system was a highly predictable victim of the neoliberal reaction, guided by the maxim of “private affluence and public squalor.” Funding for public education has sharply declined. Tuition has exploded, leading to a plague of unpayable student debt. As higher education is driven to a business model in accord with neoliberal doctrine, administrative bureaucracy has sharply increased at the expense of faculty and students, developments reviewed well by sociologist Benjamin Ginsburg. Cost-cutting dictated by the revered market principles naturally leads to hyper-exploitation of the more vulnerable, creating a new precariat of graduate students and adjuncts surviving on a bare pittance, replacing tenured faculty. All of this happens to be a good disciplinary technique, for obvious reasons. 
For those with eyes open, much of what has happened was anticipated by the early ’70s, at the point of transition from regulated capitalism to incipient neoliberalism. At the time, there was mounting elite concern about the dangers posed by the democratizing and civilizing effects of 1960s activism, and particularly the role of young people during “the time of troubles.” The concerns were forcefully expressed at both ends of the political spectrum. 
At the right end of the spectrum, the “Powell memorandum” sent by corporate lobbyist (later Supreme Court Justice) Lewis Powell to the Chamber of Commerce called upon the business community to rise up to defend itself against the assault on freedom led by Ralph Nader, Herbert Marcuse and other miscreants who had taken over the universities, the media and the government. The picture was, of course, ludicrous but it did reflect the perceptions of Powell’s audience, desperate about the slight diminution in their overwhelming power. The rhetoric is as interesting as the message, reminiscent of a spoiled three-year-old who has a piece of candy taken away. The memorandum was influential in circles that matter for policy formation. 
At the other end of the spectrum, at about the same time, the liberal internationalists of the Trilateral Commission published their lament over “The Crisis of Democracy” that arose in the “terrible”’60s, when previously apathetic and marginalized parts of the population — the great majority — began to try to enter the political arena to pursue their interests. That posed an intolerable burden on the state. Accordingly, the Trilateral scholars called for more “moderation in democracy,” a return to passivity and obedience. The American rapporteur, Harvard professor Samuel Huntington, reminisced nostalgically about the time when “Truman had been able to govern the country with the cooperation of a relatively small number of Wall Street lawyers and bankers,” so that true democracy flourished. 
A particular concern of the Trilateral scholars was the failure of the institutions responsible for “the indoctrination of the young,” including the schools and universities. These had to be brought under control, along with the irresponsible media that were (occasionally) departing from subordination to “proper authority”— a precursor of concerns of the far-right Republican Party today. There is no economic reason why free education cannot flourish from schools through colleges and university. 
The right-liberal spectrum of concerns provided a good indication of what was to come. 
The underfunding of public education, from K-12 through colleges and universities, has no plausible economic rationale, and in fact is harmful to the economy because of the losses that ensue. In other countries, rich and poor, education remains substantially free, with educational standards that rank high in global comparisons. Even in the US, higher education was almost free during the economically successful years before the neoliberal reaction — and it was, of course, a much poorer country then. The GI bill provided free education to huge numbers of people — white men overwhelmingly — who would probably never have gone to college, a great benefit to them personally and to the whole society. Tuition at private colleges was far below today’s exorbitant costs. 
Student debt is structured to be a burden for life. The indebted cannot declare bankruptcy, unlike Trump. Current student debt is estimated to be over $1.45 trillion, [more than] $600 billion more than total credit card debt. Most is unpayable, and should be rescinded. There are ample resources for that simply from waste, including the bloated military and the enormous concentrated private wealth that has accumulated in the financial and general corporate sector under neoliberal policies. 
There is no economic reason why free education cannot flourish from schools through colleges and university. The barriers are not economic but rather political decisions, skewed in the predictable direction under conditions of highly unequal wealth and power. Barriers that can be overcome, as often in the past. 
Bob, what’s your own response to the question I posed above? 
Pollin: Student debt in the US has exploded in the past decade. In 2007, total student debt was $112 billion, equal to 0.8 percent of GDP. As of 2016, total student debt was [more than] $1 trillion, equal to 5.6 percent of GDP. Thus, as a share of GDP, student debt has risen approximately seven-fold. As of 2012, nearly 70 percent of students left college carrying student loans, and these loans averaged $26,300. 
The rise in student debt reflects a combination of factors. The first is that the private costs of attending college have risen sharply, with public higher education funding having been cut sharply. Average public funding per student was 15 percent lower in 2015 than in 2008, and 20 percent lower than in 1990. The burden of the public funding cuts [has] been worsened by the stagnation of average family incomes. Thus, in 1990, average tuition, fees, room and board amounted to about 18 percent of the median household income. By 2014, this figure had nearly doubled, to 35 percent of median household income. 
Despite these sharply rising costs, college enrollments have continued to rise. There are many good reasons for young people to go off to college, open their minds, develop their skills and enjoy themselves. But probably the major attraction is the fact that income disparities have increased sharply between those who go to college versus those who do not. This pattern corresponds with the stagnation of average wages since the early 1970s that we discussed [previously]. The reality under neoliberalism has been that, if you want to have a decent shot at a good-paying job with a chance for promotions and raises over time, the most important first step is to get a college education. The pressures to go to college would be much less intense if working-class jobs provided good pay and opportunities to advance, as was the pattern prior to the onset of neoliberalism. 
Virtually all student debt in the US is now held by the federal government. It would therefore be a relatively simple matter to forgive some, if not all of it. This would enable young people to transition much more easily into creating their own households and families. At the same time, if the government is going to enact a major program of student debt forgiveness, it should be at least equally committed to relieving the heavy mortgage debt burdens still carried by tens of millions of non-affluent households in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crash and Great Recession. Similarly, the government should also be at least equally committed to both lowering the costs of college education in the first place, and [supporting] better wages and work opportunities for people who do not attend college. 
The blueprint for a progressive US that the two of you have sketched out requires that a certain course of political action is carried out … which includes educating the masses in getting from here to there. How is this to be done, especially given not only the peculiarities of American political culture, but also the balkanization of progressive and left forces in the country? 
Chomsky: The answer is both easy and hard. Easy to formulate (and familiar), and hard to execute (also familiar). The answer is education, organization [and] activism as appropriate to circumstances. Not easy, but often successful, and there’s no reason why it cannot be now. Popular engagement, though scattered, is at quite a high level, as is enthusiasm and concern. There are also important elements of unity, like the Left Forum, novel and promising. And the movements we’ve already mentioned . Significant efforts are underway, such as those alluded to briefly [before], and there’s no reason why they cannot be extended. While the left is famous for constant splits and internal disputes, I don’t think that’s more so now than in the past. And the general mood, particularly among young people, seems to me conducive to quite positive changes. It is not idle romanticism to recognize the potential that can be awakened, or arise independently, in communities that free themselves from indoctrination and passive subordination. 
I don’t feel that there is anything deep in the political culture that prevents “educating the masses.” I’m old enough to recall vividly the high level of culture, general and political, among first-generation working people during the Great Depression. Workers’ education was lively and effective, union-based — mostly the vigorous rising labor movement, reviving from the ashes of the 1920s. I’ve often seen independent and quite impressive initiatives in working-class and poor and deprived communities today. And there’s a long earlier history of lively working-class culture, from the early days of the industrial revolution. The most important radical democratic movement in American history, the populist movement (not today’s “populism”), was initiated and led by farmers in Texas and the Midwest, who may have had little formal education but understood very well the nature of their plight at the hands of the powerful banking and commercial sectors, and devised effective means to counter it…. 
I’ve been fortunate enough to have seen remarkable examples elsewhere. I recall vividly a visit to an extremely poor, almost inaccessible rural village in southern Colombia, in an area under attack from all sides, where I attended a village meeting that was concerned with protecting their resources, including irreplaceable water supplies, from predatory international mining corporations. And in particular. a young man, with very little formal education, who led a thoughtful and very informed discussion of sophisticated development plans that they intended to implement. I’ve seen the same in poor villages in West Bengal, with a handful of books in the tiny schoolroom, areas liberated from landlord rule by Communist party militancy. The opportunities and, of course, resources are vastly greater in rich societies like ours. 
I don’t think it is idle romanticism to recognize the potential that can be awakened, or arise independently, in communities that free themselves from indoctrination and passive subordination. The opportunities I think are there, to be grasped and carried forward. 
Pollin: I think it is inevitable that leftist forces in the US would be divided, if not balkanized, to some extent. Among the full range of people who are committed to social and economic equality and ecological [justice] — i.e. to some variant of a leftist vision of a decent society — it will always be the case that some will be more focused on egalitarian economic issues, others around the environment and climate change, others on US imperialism, militarism and foreign policy, others on race and gender equality, and still others on sexual identity. 
I certainly do not have the formula for how to most effectively knit all these groups together. But I do think we can learn a lot from the major successes out there. The 2016 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign is a first obvious example. Another is the California Nurses Association/National Nurses United (CNA/NNU) that I mentioned [before]. This is a union, fighting first for the well-being of its members, who are overwhelmingly women, with a high proportion being women of color. At the same time, CNA/NNU has been in the forefront of campaigns for single-payer health care and even the Robin Hood Tax on speculative Wall Street trading. 
There are other progressive organizations that have proven track records of success. One is the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE), which has long been active around both living wage and other worker rights issues, as well as community economic development and environmental justice. A more recently formed coalition is NY Renews, which is comprised of 126 organizations in New York State who have come together to advance a serious program in the state to both dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand good job opportunities. The Washington State Labor Council — part of the AFL-CIO — has also been committed and innovative in bringing together coalitions of labor and environmental groups. 
The US left needs to learn and build from the achievements and ongoing work of these and similar groups. In fact, as Margaret Thatcher used to say, “there is no alternative”— if we are serious about successfully advancing a left alternative to the disasters caused by 40 years of neoliberal hegemony.","{'uuid': 'b96d408a1d6c57117f28bcc45f7ffe5970aafea1', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmLAVpbDs_0.T.74UJH0SHVCxpTriWk2Rc_VFZ94RBJYfw2dbkiTKRGRCBy1kqHjnj1tBtidZVvU7N.y7l95lMhgYVcX.HX7b6cdmLeYF6Zg--', 'site_full': 'popularresistance.org', 'site': 'popularresistance.org', 'site_section': 'http://www.popularresistance.org/feed', 'site_categories': ['media', 'law_government_and_politics', 'politics'], 'section_title': 'PopularResistance.Org', 'title': 'Noam Chomsky & Robert Pollin: Imagining A New Social Order', 'title_full': 'Noam Chomsky & Robert Pollin: Imagining A New Social Order', 'published': '2017-11-21T20:04:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'https://popularresistance-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/11/2017_1119blu_-e1511287412179.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': None, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}",Noam Chomsky & Robert Pollin: Imagining A New Social Order,http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmLAVpbDs_0.T.74UJH0SHVCxpTriWk2Rc_VFZ94RBJYfw2dbkiTKRGRCBy1kqHjnj1tBtidZVvU7N.y7l95lMhgYVcX.HX7b6cdmLeYF6Zg--,b96d408a1d6c57117f28bcc45f7ffe5970aafea1

MATTHEW PENNINGTON,   Tuesday, November 21, 2017 11:35:59 EST AM U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson listens as President Donald Trump announces that the United States will designate North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Monday, Nov. 20, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)   
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration plans to announce Tuesday new sanctions on North Korea, after declaring it a state sponsor of terrorism in the latest push to isolate the pariah nation. 
North Korea has joined Iran, Sudan and Syria on America's terror blacklist, a largely symbolic step as the administration already has the authority to impose virtually any sanctions it wants on Kim Jong Un's government over its nuclear weapons development. 
As part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump said the Treasury Department would impose more sanctions on North Korea and ""related persons"" starting Tuesday, without hinting who or what would be targeted. The move is part of rolling effort to deprive Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs and leave it internationally isolated. 
""It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it's finished over a two-week period,"" Trump said. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday the pressure campaign was starting to bite in Pyongyang, which is already facing unprecedented U.N.-mandated sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Tillerson said anecdotal evidence and intelligence suggests the North is now suffering fuel shortages, with queues at gas stations, and its revenues are down. 
The United States has been applying sanctions of its own as well. 
In Tokyo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the move, telling reporters Japan supports the step as a way to increase pressure on North Korea. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang expressed concern. 
Lu said Tuesday that the situation is ""highly sensitive"" and that it would be ""helpful to bring all parties back to the negotiation table instead of doing the opposite."" 
Da Zhigang, a North Korea expert at the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said the move ""will arouse diplomatic reactions and hatred toward the U.S. from North Korea"" and could even prompt the North to resume missile tests. 
In September, Trump opened the way for the U.S. to punish foreign companies dealing with North Korea. He issued an executive order expanding the Treasury Department's ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with the North, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system. 
Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow on Northeast Asia at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Treasury could be preparing more designations against North Korean entities related to the terrorism listing, or possibly Chinese or other companies violating the September order. 
A potential target would be Chinese banks that serve as North Korea's conduit to the international system. Such a move would irk Beijing, whose help Trump is counting on to put an economic squeeze on Pyongyang. China recently sent its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years to discuss the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula. 
Tillerson urged China, which accounts for 90 per cent of North Korea's external trade, to take unilateral steps to cut fuel supplies to its wayward neighbour. China, which is calling for dialogue to ease the nuclear tensions, is reluctant to exert economic pressure that could destabilize the North. 
Tillerson acknowledged a two-month pause in the North's rapid tempo of nuclear and missile tests and said there was still hope for diplomacy. With tougher sanctions in the offing, he warned Kim, ""This is only going to get worse until you're ready to come and talk."" 
The terror designation, however, is likely to exacerbate sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim. North Korea shows no interest in talks aimed at getting it to give up its nukes. 
North Korea has been on and off the terror list over the years. It was designated for two decades because of its involvement in international terror attacks in the 1980s, then taken off in 2008 to smooth the way for nuclear talks that soon failed.","{'uuid': '6158b9a47ac0885a2aa7ed15d193cd6e311c3d72', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.covNnmXzmfGn0FsZSFLehPOztipgLYqRXOy3f5xFoTDEB.OQGEjIyr_4XU92DuF5UGCMiNut59r7NtpGQ1Eok.N_2HjXKjwlg94EpqQAdX8Mpu2arnkBM', 'site_full': 'www.lfpress.com', 'site': 'lfpress.com', 'site_section': '', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': '', 'title': 'Trump plans sanctions against N.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Monday the U.S. is putting North Korea's ""murderous regime"" on America's terrorism blacklist, despite questions about Pyongyang's support for international attacks beyond the assassination of its leader's half brother in February. 
Trump said the designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism was long overdue, and he promised a new wave of sanctions as part of a ""maximum pressure campaign"" over the North's development of nuclear weapons that could soon pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland.

North Korea will join Iran, Sudan and Syria on the blacklist. The North had been designated for two decades until 2008 when it was removed in a bid to salvage international talks aimed at halting its nuclear efforts. The talks collapsed soon after and haven't been revived since. 
The primary impact of the designation may be to compound North Korea's growing international isolation as it is already subject to an array of tough U.S. sanctions restricting trade, foreign assistance, defence sales and exports of sensitive technology. The step is likely to further sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim Jong Un.

There is strong bipartisan support for the move in Congress, which had passed legislation in August requiring the State Department to make a determination on putting North Korea back on the list. 
""In addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation, North Korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil,"" Trump said as he announced the designation at a Cabinet meeting at the White House. 
However, the action had been debated for months inside the administration, with some officials at the State Department arguing that North Korea did not meet the legal standard to be relisted as a state sponsor of terrorism.

U.S. officials involved in the internal deliberations said there was no debate over whether the slaying of Kim's half brother Kim Jong Nam was a terrorist act. Malaysian authorities have said he was killed by two women who smeared suspected VX nerve agent onto his face at Kuala Lumpur airport Feb. 13. 
However, lawyers said there had to be more than one incident, and there was disagreement over whether the treatment of American student Otto Warmbier, who died of injuries suffered in North Korean custody, constituted terrorism.

Neither Trump nor the State Department specified Monday which acts of terrorism and assassination the North had supported. In making the announcement, Trump did refer to Warmbier ""and the countless others so brutally affected"" by North Korean oppression. 
He said more sanctions would be imposed on North Korea and ""related persons"" that the Treasury Department would begin to announce Tuesday — part of rolling effort to deprive Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs and leave it internationally isolated. 
""It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it's finished over a two-week period,"" Trump said.

Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies think-tank , said the designation does not grant sanctions authority that the administration does not already have but will help ""push additional countries to cut commercial and diplomatic ties with North Korea."" 
Some analysts have said Pyongyang could use the designation as a pretext for renewed weapons tests after a two-month hiatus. The latest missile test overflew Japan Sept. 15.

House legislation introduced this year had urged the State Department to review a list of purported acts by North Korea, including assassinations of dissidents and weapons sales to militant groups including Hamas and Hezbollah. It requested a determination as to whether such acts constitute support for international terrorism. 
The legislation also cited the 2015 computer hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which the FBI blamed on North Korea. Hackers threatened movie theatres that screened ""The Interview,"" a comedy parodying the North's leader, Kim.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai is following through on his pledge to repeal 2015 regulations designed to ensure that internet service providers treat all online content and apps equally. Pai distributed his alternative plan to the net neutrality rules to other FCC commissioners Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2017, in preparation for a Dec. 14 vote on the proposal. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) By: Ryan Nakashima And Michael Liedtke The Associated Press Published on MENLO PARK, Calif. — The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission set out Tuesday to scrap rules around open internet access, a move that would allow giant cable and telecom companies to throttle broadband speeds and favour their own services if they wish. Ajit Pai followed through on a pledge to try to repeal ""net neutrality"" regulations enacted under the Obama administration. The current rules treat internet service providers such as Comcast, AT&T and Verizon as if they were utility companies that provide essential services, like electricity. The rules mandate that they give equal access to all online content and apps. Pai said those rules discourage investments that could provide even better and faster online access. Instead, he said new rules would force ISPs to be transparent about their services and management policies, and then would let the market decide. ""Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,"" Pai said in a statement. Pai distributed his alternative plan to other FCC commissioners Tuesday in preparation for a Dec. 14 vote. Pai promised to release his entire proposal Wednesday. Although the FCC's two Democrats said they will oppose the proposal, the repeal is likely to prevail as Republicans dominate 3-2. The vote for net neutrality in 2015 was also along party lines, but Democrats dominated then. Equal treatment for all web traffic has been a fundamental principle of the internet since its creation but companies have increasingly put their thumb on the scales of access. AT&T, for example, doesn't count use of its streaming service DirecTV Now against wireless data caps, potentially making it seem cheaper to its cellphone customers than rival TV services. Rivals would have to pay AT&T for that privilege. Regulators, consumer advocates and some tech companies are concerned that repealing net neutrality will give ISPs even more power to block or slow down rival offerings. A repeal also opens the ability for ISPs to charge a company like Netflix for a faster path to its customers. Allowing this paid-priority market to exist could skew prices and create winners and losers among fledgling companies that require a high-speed connection to end users. Pai, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, said in an interview on Fox News Radio that Trump did not have any input on his proposal. Asked whether deregulation would result in higher prices and put speedy internet access out of the reach of blue-collar Americans, Pai said ""it's going to mean exactly the opposite."" ""These heavy-handed regulations have made it harder for the private sector to build out the networks especially in rural America,"" Pai said. In a Wall Street Journal editorial published Tuesday, Pai cited a report by a non-profit think-tank , the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, that said investment by the dozen largest ISPs fell about 2 per cent from 2015 to 2016, to $61 billion. The group didn't link the drop solely to the stiffer rules introduced in 2015. The attempt to repeal net neutrality has triggered protests from consumer groups and internet companies. A data firm called Emprata that was backed by a telecom industry group found in August that after filtering out form letters, the overwhelming majority of comments to the FCC — about 1.8 million — favoured net neutrality, compared with just 24,000 who supported its repeal. Carmen Scurato, director of policy and legal affairs for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said ISPs' ability to impose monthly caps on data use already act to raise prices and limit access. Repealing net neutrality, she said, ""is just erecting more barriers."" Among those that will be hit hardest are startups that depend on high-speed internet connections for growth, said Colin Angle, co-founder and CEO of iRobot, maker of the Roomba robot vacuum cleaners. He said his own company wouldn't be dramatically affected in the near term, but the nascent robotics industry overall might. ""The need for these robots to consume bandwidth is certainly on the rise,"" Angle said. Google said in a statement that net neutrality rules ""are working well for consumers and we're disappointed in the proposal announced today."" Other tech companies were more muted, with some referring instead to their trade group, the Internet Association. Netflix, which had been vocal in support of the rules in 2015, tweeted that it ""supports strong #NetNeutrality"" and opposes the rules rollback. But the streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere. AT&T executive vice-president Joan Marsh said new rules requiring ISPs to disclose their management practices will keep them honest. ""Any ISP that is so foolish as to seek to engage in gatekeeping will be quickly and decisively called out,"" she said in a statement. Comcast said its commitment to consumers will remain the same. ""We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content,"" Comcast's senior executive vice-president David Cohen said. Pai's plan also restores the Federal Trade Commission as the main watchdog to protect consumers and promote competition. But Democratic Commissioner Mignon L. Clyburn said the proposal was ""a giveaway to the nation's largest communications companies."" Pai's proposal on net neutrality comes after the Republican-dominated commission voted 3-2 last week to weaken rules meant to support independent local media, undoing a ban on companies owning newspapers and broadcast stations in a single market. ___ Liedtke reported from San Francisco.

Nebraska's Public Service Commission cleared a path for TransCanada 's proposed Keystone XL pipeline on Monday when it granted final approval in a narrow 3-2 vote for the line to pass through the state, removing a major regulatory barrier for the project. 
The approval, though, came with a hitch. The Commission rejected TransCanada's preferred route for the project, as well as the original one which would have passed through the ecologically sensitive Sandhills region, instead approving the ""alternative mainline route"". 
The alternative mainline route would send Keystone XL, which aims to ship 0.83m barrels a day of heavy oil from Canada's oil sands to the Gulf Coast, into counties further east in the state where it would run nearer to the existing Keystone pipeline's route. 
The commission was looking for a middle ground between advocates that wanted to see the pipeline built and sceptics that argued the line should, if built at all, travel a route that takes advantage of the existing infrastructure. 
TransCanada lobbied hard for its preferred route throughout the approval process, making the ruling a disappointment even though it offers the clearest path yet to seeing the project through to completion. ""The preferred route was the product of literally years of study, analysis, and refinement by Keystone, federal agencies and Nebraska agencies. No alternative route, including the Keystone mainline alternative, the Sandhills alternative, or anything argued for by the intervenors, comes close to the quality of the preferred route,"" the company argued in a briefing to the Commission's regulators earlier this year. 
Although TransCanada proposed the mainline alternative to show state regulators an option that would take advantage of existing Keystone infrastructure, it later concluded that simply laying Keystone XL along Keystone's original path was not possible. Because of easement conditions, natural barriers and other regulatory rules, TransCanada experts said, just 38.3 miles of the route were actually suitable for so-called ""co-location"". ""The mainline alternative route would require placing Keystone XL in a sub-optimal location because the mainline is already on the best site,"" TransCanada said in the briefing. Extra costs 
For TransCanada, the ruling throws up a host of new issues. The line will undoubtedly be more expensive, requiring more pipe to cover the longer route and an additional pumping station to keep the crude flowing through the line. It will also require TransCanada to win over a host of new landowners along the alternative route. Those landowners, one of the Commissioners that voted against approval pointed out, probably didn't even know their property was being seriously considered as a route for Keystone XL. While many landowners along the preferred Keystone XL route opposed the project, more than 90% had signed on with TransCanada. 
Opponents of the pipeline, which have led years of highly-charged protests against Keystone XL and successfully pushed it into the national political conversation, seized on the fact that the alternative mainline route was approved. They said it opened new avenues for regulatory and legal challenges, pointing out that the approved route had been through much less regulatory scrutiny than the preferred route, which had been the focus of most of the attention. 
The State Department is looking at the decision to see if it will have to issue a new environmental impact study. The alternative mainline route was not included in the 2014 survey that underpins the Presidential Permit that Donald Trump signed off on earlier this year . The key question will be whether or not the new route is substantially different enough to trigger a new environmental study. A new federal study would set the project back for months if not years. 
TransCanada's brief statement following the decision wasn't exactly a victory lap. ""As a result of today's decision, we will conduct a careful review of the Public Service Commission's ruling while assessing how the decision would impact the cost and schedule of the project,"" the company's boss Russ Girling said. Filling the pipeline 
On top of sorting through the new political questions, TransCanada is still in the process of getting producers to commit to filling the pipeline. On that front, Girling sounded confident earlier this month in an investor call following the end of Keystone XL's ""open season"" in late October. ""We anticipate the support for the project to be substantially similar to that which existed when we first applied for the Keystone pipeline permit,"" Girling said in a 9 November analyst call. The comments indicate that major Canadian producers haven't backed away from the project given the years of uncertainty surrounding its viability. The company wants firm commitments of 0.5m b/d before moving ahead with the project. 
The market will be watching developments closely as the need for new heavy oil supplies in the Gulf Coast grow. The two major heavy oil suppliers into the US' main refining base, Venezuela and Mexico, have both seen supplies plummet. Since 2011, when the Obama administration first rejected the project, exports from those countries have fallen by roughly 0.9m b/d, and there is little likelihood of a recovery anytime soon. Canada's Keystone XL backers argue they are the answer to the Gulf Coast's heavy oil supply worries.

""It should have happened a long time ago,"" Trump... The U.S. government redesignated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism on Monday. The move, announced by President Donald Trump during a brief photo op at a Cabinet meeting, was designed to put pressure on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. 
""It should have happened a long time ago,"" Trump... (Adam Taylor) 
Also sanctioned were Chinese national Sun Sidong and his company, Dandong Dongyuan Industrial Co., said to have exported more than $28 million worth of goods to the North. 
The targeting of Chinese companies is a sore point with Beijing, whose help Trump is counting on to put an economic squeeze on Pyongyang. China recently sent its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years to discuss the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula. 
""China firmly opposes unilateral sanctions out of the U.N. Security Council framework,"" the Chinese Embassy in Washington said Tuesday, ""especially the imposition of the so-called 'long-arm jurisdiction' by other countries in accordance with their domestic laws."" 
As part of its effort to stymie North Korean transportation networks, the Treasury Department sanctioned North Korea's Maritime Administration and its transport ministry, six North Korean shipping and trading companies and 20 of their vessels, which are all North Korean-flagged. 
It accused North Korea of deceptive shipping practices, including ship-to-ship transfers, which is prohibited under U.N. sanctions that have been imposed in response to Pyongyang's rapid tempo of nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The Treasury statement included aerial photos of what it said was Korea Kumbyol Trading Company's vessel Rye Song Gang 1 possibly transferring oil to evade sanctions that have restricted fuel exports to the North. 
Also sanctioned was the Korea South-South Cooperation Corporation, said to have exported North Korean workers to China, Russia, Cambodia and Poland to generate revenue for the government. 
When President Donald Trump announced the terror designation of North Korea on Monday, he promised to intensify the ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Pyongyang with the ""highest level"" of sanctions yet — part of a rolling effort to compel it to negotiate over its nuclear program, which poses an emerged threat to the U.S. mainland. 
An editorial Tuesday in North Korea's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called Trump a ""heinous criminal"" who had insulted the dignity of the country's supreme leadership and its socialist system during his recent visit to South Korea. The editorial, carried by the state-run news agency, threatened ""merciless punishment."" It did not mention the terror designation or the threat of new sanctions. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged Monday a two-month pause in the North's nuclear and missile tests and said there was still hope for diplomacy. With tougher sanctions in the offing, he warned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un : ""This is only going to get worse until you're ready to come and talk."" 
The terror designation, however, is likely to exacerbate sour relations between Washington and Pyongyang that have turned uglier with name-calling between Trump and Kim. North Korea shows no interest in talks aimed at getting it to give up its nukes. 
North Korea has joined Iran, Sudan and Syria on America's terror blacklist, a position it has occupied on and off the terror list over the years. It was designated for two decades because of its involvement in international terror attacks in the 1980s, then taken off in 2008 to smooth the way for nuclear talks that soon failed.","{'uuid': '8588f6c13f47e6f0143b78c2293f8a5de292712c', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ScoimW67Wq8bSaq4wH9DrO0iDN1V6hfIsG7hPNd7p86UmlN0sjNPKEXWPav0mKnVTsLlkalOETzZ0PnNWRosevSi9YaYefRx48oB5yJd4opHlJK1ZhGoL', 'site_full': 'www.chicagotribune.com', 'site': 'chicagotribune.com', 'site_section': 'http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/rss2.0.xml#', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'Nation/World  - Baltimore Sun', 'title': 'U.S. readies new sanctions against North Korea, individuals', 'title_full': 'U.S. readies new sanctions against North Korea, individuals', 'published': '2017-11-21T19:04:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'http://www.trbimg.com/img-5a145d90/turbine/ct-north-korea-sanctions-20171121', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 1272, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}","U.S. readies new sanctions against North Korea, individuals",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ScoimW67Wq8bSaq4wH9DrO0iDN1V6hfIsG7hPNd7p86UmlN0sjNPKEXWPav0mKnVTsLlkalOETzZ0PnNWRosevSi9YaYefRx48oB5yJd4opHlJK1ZhGoL,8588f6c13f47e6f0143b78c2293f8a5de292712c

""This is a beautiful tree. Thank you so much. We will decorate it very nicely,"" the first lady told the Chapmans and other family members. ""I hope you can come and visit with us."" 
The White House grounds superintendent and the chief usher, who oversees the residence, picked out the tree during a September scouting trip. 
After Mrs. Trump and Barron gave their symbolic approval, the tree was carefully carted off to the Blue Room where, after a slight trim and the removal of a monstrous chandelier, it will take center stage. 
President Donald Trump has been eagerly waiting to celebrate a Trump Christmas at the White House. During last year's presidential campaign, he railed against the habit of saying ""Happy holidays"" instead of ""Merry Christmas,"" characterizing it as a ""chipping away at Christianity."" 
""And we're not going to let that happen anymore, folks. I'll tell you,"" the then-candidate said at a March 2016 news conference in Florida. ""A lot of times I'll say at the rallies around Christmastime we're going to start saying Merry Christmas again. You know, they don't say it anymore. The department stores don't put it up. We're going to start saying it again."" 
Invitations to dozens of holiday parties hosted by the Trumps are going out. The subject line of one emailed invite references a White House ""Christmas reception"" while the language of the invitation itself refers to a ""holiday reception."" 
The tree for the Blue Room usually arrives the day after Thanksgiving, but it was delivered early this year to accommodate the Trumps, who are spending the holiday at their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. 
While the Trumps are away, a small army of volunteer decorators and florists from around the country will descend on the White House on Friday and spend the holiday weekend transforming the 132-room mansion for Christmas, complete with a tree in every public room. 
The White House kitchens will go into overdrive preparing all the food and cakes, cookies and pies that are typically served at the parties, along with the gingerbread White House — which, for health reasons, is never eaten. In recent years, cookies in the image of former President Barack Obama's dogs Bo and Sunny were always among the first items to be slipped into purses for the trip home. 
Trump does not have a pet. 
The White House plans to unveil the holiday decor on Monday, and the first lady will also welcome children and students from Joint Base Andrews for a holiday arts and crafts event. The president plans to light the National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse on Thursday.","{'uuid': 'b052e59f3aa0c2116b502a0b22f2a6d039d3a43a', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ScoimW67Wq8bSaq4wH9DrO0iDN1V6hfIsG7hPNd7p86UmlN0sjNPKOBDdEOsY00K6YglUO0EgM70.okeX6zcjVZ7ZRshsHLFEZ5mvfu31ndRceFp4DutPa9tbLDlhpLI-', 'site_full': 'www.chicagotribune.com', 'site': 'chicagotribune.com', 'site_section': 'http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/rss2.0.xml#', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'Nation/World  - Baltimore Sun', 'title': 'Melania Trump, son Barron receive White House Christmas tree', 'title_full': 'Melania Trump, son Barron receive White House Christmas tree', 'published': '2017-11-21T18:32:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'http://www.trbimg.com/img-5a144c2b/turbine/ct-white-house-christmas-tree-20171121', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': 1272, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 12, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 12}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}","Melania Trump, son Barron receive White House Christmas tree",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ScoimW67Wq8bSaq4wH9DrO0iDN1V6hfIsG7hPNd7p86UmlN0sjNPKOBDdEOsY00K6YglUO0EgM70.okeX6zcjVZ7ZRshsHLFEZ5mvfu31ndRceFp4DutPa9tbLDlhpLI-,b052e59f3aa0c2116b502a0b22f2a6d039d3a43a

MOSCOW — Syrian President Bashar Assad was asked to come to Russia to get him to agree to potential peace initiatives drafted by Russia, Iran and Turkey as Russia prepares to scale down its military presence in the country's 6-year war, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.President Vladimir Putin hosted Assad in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Monday ahead of a summit between Russia, Turkey and Iran and a new round of Syria peace talks in Geneva. The meeting was unannounced and the Kremlin did not make it public until Tuesday morning.""I passed to (Putin) and all Russian people our greetings and gratitude for all of the efforts that Russia made to save our country,"" Assad told Russia's top brass.Assad has only ventured outside his war-ravaged nation twice since the conflict began — both times to Russia. This week's visit to meet Putin is his second since the crisis began in March 2011 leading to a civil war that has killed some 400,000 and resulted in millions of refugees.The first was in October 2015, shortly after Russia launched its military campaign in Syria to shore up Assad's forces which turned the war in favor of Assad.The meeting in Sochi, which lasted three hours, came ahead of a summit at the same place between the presidents of Iran, Russia and Turkey. Iran and Russia have been Assad's main backers while Turkey supports the opposition.Putin had spoken with the leaders of Iran and Turkey to ""assure them that Russia will work with Syrian leadership to prepare the groundwork for possible understandings"" that could reached on Wednesday to ""make sure"" that agreements reached will be ""viable,"" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday.The Kremlin said Putin would phone President Donald Trump and Saudi King Salman to discuss the situation in Syria on Wednesday.Asked whether Putin and Assad have talked about the Syrian president's future in post-war Syria, Peskov said ""possible options for political settlement have been discussed."" Faced with pressure from other nations urging Assad to step down, Moscow has insisted that it is up to the Syrian people to vote Assad in or out.With the Syrian government controlling most of the country and Islamic State fighters in disarray, Putin told Assad at the Monday meeting that Moscow is about to curtail its military presence there.""Regarding our joint operation to fight terrorists in Syria, this military operation is indeed coming to an end,"" he told Assad in televised remarks. ""I'm pleased to see your willingness to work with everyone who wants peace and settlement.""The Kremlin has announced scale-downs and a halt in its operation in Syria before but did not follow through. Putin in March 2016 ordered that a withdrawal from Syria, saying ""all the tasks have been accomplished."" In January, Russia said it is pulling out its aircraft carrier and other warships from the waters off Syria. Russia continued to operate warships off the Syrian shore as late as this fall.Footage and photographs released by the Kremlin press office showed Putin giving Assad a warm embrace upon his arrival at Putin's residence in Sochi.Russian television showed footage of Putin and Assad entering a meeting with the top brass of Russia's defense ministry and the General Staff.""I asked the Syrian president to stop by,"" Putin told the Russian generals. He then referred to Assad and said: ""I would like to introduce you to people who played a key role in saving Syria.""Assad's office quoted him as thanking Russia and its military, which he said ""gave martyrs and made efforts in Syria."" He added: ""I was very happy to know that you are here since you are the officers who directly took part in the battle in Syria.""Assad said the Russian Air Force helped Syrian troops in the fight against insurgents, helping many Syrians to return to their homes. ""In the name of the Syrian people, I greet you and thank you all, every Russian officer, fighter and pilot that took part in this war.""The meeting came two days after Syrian troops and their allies captured the eastern town of Boukamal, the last major inhabited area held by the IS group in Syria. Syrian troops and their Iran-backed allies marched into the town under the cover of Russian airstrikes.__","{'uuid': '93ce6c450b343131931bc8bffe7b6f541f4ded77', 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8lNCSdR_GmvzMP_YdDnNV7BoiXkC2tna6NZbiVcGkMWDiGC8gT0uuZP.0NC3IUw1NDHRBwshDWiAXdIS1iTf.7G8JVrcaGSkbhQFAMDqdRGcUPtQ9ECy4U', 'site_full': 'www.norwichbulletin.com', 'site': 'norwichbulletin.com', 'site_section': 'http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/government?template=rss&mime=xml', 'site_categories': ['media'], 'section_title': 'Government - The Bulletin', 'title': ""Syria's Assad travels to Russia, meets with Putin"", 'title_full': ""Syria's Assad travels to Russia, meets with Putin"", 'published': '2017-11-21T13:50:00.000+02:00', 'replies_count': 0, 'participants_count': 1, 'site_type': 'news', 'country': 'US', 'spam_score': 0.0, 'main_image': 'http://www.norwichbulletin.com/storyimage/CT/20171121/NEWS/171129934/AR/0/AR-171129934.jpg', 'performance_score': 0, 'domain_rank': None, 'social': {'facebook': {'likes': 0, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}}}","Syria's Assad travels to Russia, meets with Putin",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8lNCSdR_GmvzMP_YdDnNV7BoiXkC2tna6NZbiVcGkMWDiGC8gT0uuZP.0NC3IUw1NDHRBwshDWiAXdIS1iTf.7G8JVrcaGSkbhQFAMDqdRGcUPtQ9ECy4U,93ce6c450b343131931bc8bffe7b6f541f4ded77
